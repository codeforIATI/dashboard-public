In the last 40+ years of operation, we have been present in every region of the world. Today, the CISP is active in more than 30 countries with initiatives for the affirmation of fundamental rights and social inclusion, the fight against inequalities and social injustice, the creation of economic and social opportunities as well as the protection of marginalised people.
We have achieved important goals, the most crucial of which is to have supported millions of people in their pursuit of self-determination. Women, children, elderly, men and communities that do not give in to marginality, violence, food insecurity and a lack of rights. Together with these people, their communities, associations, local authorities and institutions, we have built schools and trained teachers, innovated education systems, strengthened food security through diversification of income sources and micro-credit and improved agricultural production by small-scale producers. We have also contributed to the definition and implementation of public policies so that they take into account the needs and rights of the least protected sections of the population, promoted laws to protect the weakest and brought drinking water to places where there had never been any.
In 2018, we updated our Declaration of Intent - Rights, Change, Sustainability - incorporating all the strategic guidelines of the 2030 Agenda as well as each of its Sustainable Development Goals. There are two basic guidelines of the 2030 Agenda on which we are focusing in practice: the need to address sustainability in all its dimensions (environment, society, economy, institutions) and the need to combat poverty and social exclusion as interdependent objectives.

The below articles describe the principles which guide Mama Cash and its partners to make decisions to publish only parts of the information or to not publish any information of the activity. Mama Cash partners can include additional principles that apply only for their individual publication of data resulting of their activities undertaken.

General principles for exclusion
1.1 External relations
Mama Cash will not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, local institutions, its partners, individuals or (back) donors. All stakeholders are informed upfront about the Mama Cash exclusion policy before publishing data. The stakeholders have a possibility to request exclusion, based on the principles in this exclusion policy which need to be followed up by Mama Cash. Mama Cash is, at all times, the final decision-maker for exclusion of data.
1.2 Security and safety
Mama Cash will not publish data of which it can reasonably be expected that it might pose a risk to the physical or psycological safety or security of any individuals, members of staff, groups of beneficiaries, partner organizations, (back) donors or suppliers. 
1.3 Privacy
Mama Cash will not publish any activity information (photos, names, personal information) that is traceable to an individual person and can reasonably be judged as an invasion of the privacy of that person.
1.4 Legal/Contractual
Mama Cash will not publish data if it does not have the right to publish the data or if contractual agreements with (back) donors or partner organisations impede Mama Cash’s right to publish the data.
1.5 Social Impact
Mama Cash will not publish data that possibly harm the social impact of their partners in general and/or the activity undertaken by the partner.
1.6 Operational damage
Mama Cash will not publish if sharing information on an activity (ties) could be disadvantageous to its success.
1.7 Details
Mama Cash will not publish unnecessarily detailed information such as exact dates and locations. The level of detail that can be given depends on the type of activity. Activities which are generally considered safe can be published at the national level while very sensitive activities will be published at the regional level.
1.8  Openness about the exclusion policy
Mama Cash will be transparent about the exclusion policy that it applies. This policy will therefore be published on its website. CMI! Consortium members will publish all excluded activities as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier and the total commitments for the activity.
1.9  Data Quality
Mama Cash values the quality and consistency of their open data. Therefore Mama Cash will publish only activities data that meet the minimum requirements of secure and liable information. Data that do not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.
2.0 Financal data
Mama Cash will publish financial data annually as the costs for publishing/obtaining the data are too high in relation to the relevance of the data for the public. 
",0,NL,"Mama Cash is dedicated to advancing and defending the human rights of women, girls and trans people worldwide.

Our goal is to contribute to strong feminist groups and movements that organise together to end inequality and injustice. 
Because courageous women’s, girls’ and trans people’s human rights organisations worldwide need funding and supportive networks in order to grow and transform their communities, Mama Cash mobilises resources from individuals and institutions, makes grants to women’s, girls’ and trans people’s human rights organisations, and helps to build the partnerships and networks needed to successfully defend and advance women’s, girls’ and trans people’s human rights globally.

We are enablers of ecosystem solutions that are transformative to end poverty, marginalisation and create wealth for small-producers and marginalised communities in India and developing nations.   We achieve this through innovation, knowledge and transformative actions, while engaging across grass-root to policy levels. 

We are here as there are number of societal problems, such as poverty and inequity, marginalisation and vulnerability to diseases, disasters, etc., low capabilities and lack of voice of people, and lack of services and opportunities; and these continue to grow.  Solutions exist, but are usually isolated, verticalised and hardly converge to create impact or reach scale.  We, as social entrepreneurs, try our best to facilitate solutions, rather than leaving it to the Government or to the people themselves. 

We strongly believe that ‘Sustainable Livelihood Approach’ can be a great lever to address poverty, marginalisation and inclusive development.  It is very important that these approaches are customised to address different forms of marginalisation, people’s needs, aspirations and the local context.  All our design and work starts with ‘People-First and People at the Centre‘– empathy-led designs distinct from technical/ scientific designs.  

To us, scale is about reach and impact at the community… how depth and width that we have contributed to and for how long these benefits sustain.   Our solutions should therefore be modelled to take us to the scale. We don’t get satisfied with doing it at a few places or with few people.  We therefore ‘model’ our approaches, ‘cost’ them, and ‘integrate’ them to be adopted by communities or market or public policy.

We are passionate about measurement, critiquing ourselves and improve.  We work through result-based planning tools, performance measurement metrics, impact and value for money assessments and use technology where feasible. 

We current reach out to about 310,000 families, which includes farming households, communities that are vulnerable to HIV, communities that are affected with limited access to drinking water, sanitation and disaster affected.   We work through Four Models of livelihood transformation, which are built on different development approaches for different profiles of people - entitlement-focused models to market based models, and hybrid models. 

We work across seven states in India, and work through about 162 community based organisations (such as producer companies/ cooperatives, federations of marginalised groups, etc.)

Its objectives are to promote co-operation, knowledge sharing and capacity building among African tax administrations, as well as represent the interests of African tax systems in the global environment. Over the last 10 years since its launch in 2009, ATAF has been the premier pan-African organisation with a specific focus on the improvement of tax systems, freeing African countries from aid dependency and enabling the provision of better services for their citizens.  
ATAF’s role has been increasingly recognised in African countries, on the continent more generally and in the global tax environment.  It has a high reputation for the effectiveness of its work, and the significance of its impact through important international networks which actively contribute to the global tax agenda.
ATAF work directly focuses on 2 key areas: technical assistance and research which inform its broader representative role.
Specifically, ATAF offers technical support and advisory services to Revenue Authorities through country-based programmes on domestic and international taxes and tax systems including audit, and administrative structures, and domestic and international tax policy, exchange of information. It also carries out capacity building training.  ATAF also has an important research arm which has developed vehicles such as the African Tax Outlook, the African Research Network and the Executive master’s degree on Taxation.

PfG envisions: “A world where people own an opportunity to live and prosper with dignity”.

Global Communities sought a viable way to carry forward in Jordan the learning and methodologies that have been the foundations of its successful programs in child labor, good governance, youth empowerment and workforce development, entrepreneurship and innovation. Based on these goals, Global Communities founded Partners for Good. Partners for Good, carried on with the robust body of work developed by Global Communities, and innovated its own ideas, approaches and interventions to support various aspects concentrated for youth empowerment and development in Jordan. This manifested in planning and implementing various research, data collection, youth engagement, youth-led initiatives and programs which Partners for Good either led or participated in.

NewBeginnings stands with a new hope. When Dr. Saraswathi Iyer, HoD of Acharya Nagarjuna University joined in one of our Youth Leaders’ Capacity Building, she said, “NewBeginnings is really a New Beginning for the marginalised”
NCT became a registered ngo on 23rd Nov, 2009. It all started when three of the founding members who have long years of professional experience in social works decided to have a ngo that thinks differently and is bold enough to stand with those who are vulnerable. We deliberately choose target groups who are ignored, live in utter poverty for generations; We choose areas where others don’t usually go. We don’t expect sustainability in our projects. We aim at Chain of Sustainable Impact in our projects. What we mean by CSI – the beneficiary of a project should become a benefactor to her/his own neighbour. A trained youth of our project should train another youth in the same vocational skill; a child who is sponsored right now for her education should promise that she would educate another poor child when she is able to earn; a women group which has been trained in how to counsel and avoid domestic violence should talk to women in their neighbourhoods. Thus, we multiply the grant we receive from our donors. 
At the heart of our mission is transparency. A well-organized Management Structure headed by the Governing Body and is well connected to the stakeholders of our programmes.
NewBeginnings has a clearly written down policies and System in place. Be sure, you will be working with a professionally managed organisation: A clearly written down Management policies, Staff polices, Finance Polices, Volunteers’ Policies and Networking Policies etc guide us in our daily work.
Where there is no hope, we begin to give hope; where people feel that they have come to a dead-end, we want to start again. NewBeginnings gives a New Beginning in every heart; show them a way to live. Life it to the full.  ","- Data is pertained to only the target area/ group

CEHRD was founded by conservationists, environmentalists, activists, and health workers in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. CEHRD was formed to respond to the environmental, human rights, rural health, and underdevelopment problems plaguing the Niger Delta.

CEHRD’s scope is local and national in nature. While we liaise with international groups by way of networks and coalitions, our primary focus remains improving on peoples’ traditional knowledge of biodiversity conservation, monitoring, documenting and reporting of human rights violations, and advocating for justice, particularly in the Niger Delta region.

2. The ratio of women to men we serve is 55:45.      

CEHRD’s work spans through the entire Niger Delta. Our main focus is on the rural areas, its people, biodiversity conservation, rural health and population. We also monitor document and report human rights violations across the region. In some of the cases, CEHRD provides legal advocacy to victims of human rights violations. With an unemployment rate of over 70%, dire poverty, and dim prospects, some young men seek financial and physical security by joining armed gangs, or ""cults.""  Many of these cults are periodically sponsored by local government officials and/or community leaders to carry out campaigns of violence designed to influence local decision-making, especially during election periods. Often, these gangs are also used to sway village leaders and communities' opinions on oil-related projects.  In all cases, the influx of cheap arms has led to a drastic increase in violence.

It has become a beacon for Welsh efforts to help deliver the UN Millennium Development Goals to halve global poverty by 2015. 


The main responsibility for international development within the United Kingdom lies with the UK Department for International Development (DfID). However, there is a demand within Wales for there to be an identifiable Welsh response to contributing to international development and addressing emergencies.

Actions that we take in support of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) must have a benefit to Wales as well as to the developing world. This imposes limits to the range of activities we can support but at the same time ensures that our actions will be more sustainable and based on equal partnerships.

The Wales for Africa programme seeks to:

•encourage public sector placements and twinning which contribute to MDG delivery; 

•build the capacity of small Welsh International Development Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and aid the co-ordination of the sector as a whole in order to strengthen Wales’ impact on MDG delivery; 

•promote and encourage international sustainable development volunteering to the Welsh public and public sector staff; 

•work with partners to facilitate the work of diaspora communities in Wales in maximising their impact on MDG delivery in their home country;
 
•promote best practice in Fair trade and ethical procurement across the public and private sector in Wales - making Wales a beacon of fair trade and ethical procurement in Europe.

A travers la promotion de la culture de la participation citoyenne et de la redevabilité, le SPONG fédère, coordonne la participation au développement des ONG/AD et porte leurs voix dans l’élaboration, la mise en oeuvre et l’évaluation des politiques publiques en tant qu’un des porte-parole de la société civile.
NOTRE VISION « Un Burkina Faso, où les ONG/AD-Fondations ont une voix et les capacités pour participer à la réalisation d'une société juste, équitable, pacifique, résiliente et démocratique »
NOS VALEURS : BONNE GOUVERNANCE - DIVERSITE - DIALOGUE - SOLIDARITE
HISTORIQUE
Pour faire face à l’ampleur des besoins et au souci d’une meilleure efficacité dans le contexte de la grande sécheresse qui a frappé le sahel entre 1970 -1974, 17 ONG ont décidé de se regrouper dans un cadre fédérateur. Objectif, mieux se connaitre, agir sur le terrain avec plus de cohérence et aller ensemble en dialogue avec l’Etat et les partenaires techniques et financiers. Cela a aboutit en avril 1975, à la création du collectif SPONG, déclaré conformément à la loi n°18/AL du 31 Août 1959, sous le Récépissé N° 10/IS/DGI du 09 avril 1975 et agrée par le Gouvernement du Burkina Faso à travers une convention signée en 1987. Chevalier de l’Ordre du mérite burkinabè en 2004, le SPONG a été élevé au rang d’Officier de l’Ordre du mérite en 2014.
NOS MISSIONS
Le SPONG a une triple mission:
 Une mission de représentation et de service
d’interface entre le gouvernement, les partenaires non gouvernementaux au développement dans le processus de décentralisation, les initiatives à la base et la démarche associative;
Une mission d’information et de facilitation à l’égard des mouvements et associations de la société civile pour la mise en commun de leurs actions;
 Une mission de mobilisation et d’animation propre à favoriser la mobilisation de l’opinion des acteurs non gouvernementales touchant à la vie économique et sociale du pays.
NOS OBJECTIFS
 Favoriser / faciliter la concertation entre les ONG membres d’une part, et entre les ONG membres et les organismes étatiques d’autres parts, en vue de parvenir à une meilleure efficacité;
 Constituer un réseau d’information des ONG et associations, du public, du gouvernement, des orga-nismes privés et publics interafricains et internatio-naux, sur les activités des membres, les financements obtenus, les projets exécutés et ceux en cours d’exé-cution;
 Développer les contacts et assurer la concertation avec les collectifs d’ONG du Burkina Faso et des autres pays pour favoriser la mise en relation des ONG membres avec les ONG ou organismes exté-rieurs;
 Promouvoir les intérêts de ses membres vis-à-vis de l’Etat et de tout autre partenaire.
DOMAINES D’INTERVENTIONS
L’information à travers la collecte et la diffusion des opportunités d’actions et de financements au profit des ONG/AD membres auprès des Partenaires Techniques et Financiers;
• Le réseautage à travers l’animation de huit (08) groupes thématiques internes et bien d’autres réseaux nationaux et internationaux pour la conduite des actions de plaidoyer au niveau national et international (Aide Publique au Développement, Accord de Partenariat Economique, OMD…);
• L’influence des politiques publiques à travers la représentation de la société civile burkinabé dans les structures de référence au plan national et international;
• La capitalisation et la valorisation des bonnes pratiques des ONG/AD membres à travers des recherches et l’animation d’une bibliothèque spécialisée, un site portail et un bulletin d’information trimestriel;

Vision
Our vision keeps us focused on what we strive for: to be a dynamic non-profit, youth and adult based organisation whose mandate is to promote their education. And advocate for what is vital: no youth's or adult's personal, social or professional success should be limited by their race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity.

We're a training provider organisation that provides youth workers, adult educators as well as young and adults learners with learning opportunities through training processes and create the educational materials that meet their learning needs based on assessed needs and gaps toward their social, personal and professional development.

Core values
We don't accept funds from donors who could directly or indirectly, compromise our independence. We are non-partisan; we certainly don't embrace political cause. We maintain neutrality in our actions as we aim to keep our mandate objectively to effectively tackle the challenges to youth education and respond to their learning needs.",0,0,0,21,0,cc-by-sa,active,0

A country with few natural resources, Jordan looks to its human resources as the key element for its success in the markets of the region, and the prosperity, health, and security of its people. Despite the very high enrolment rates and the availability of access to schools across the Kingdom, the quality of education remains uneven. The average achievement in urban areas is higher than that in the rural and more remote areas. One of the major challenges of the Ministry of Education is to provide the schools with the required budget to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum learning in all schools across the Kingdom. The schools in remote areas lack sufficient electricity to operate daily services such as providing efficient heating and cooling systems within the classrooms lighting the classrooms, connecting computers and online learning, in extreme temperatures and lack of sufficient financial resources to improve the schools’ environment. A further challenge is, the large influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan, since 2011 has increased the load on the Kingdom’s already limited resources. Key drivers of tension between the hosting communities and the refugees at the micro-level are safeguarding livelihoods and competition for income-generating opportunities; the struggle to find adequate, affordable housing; and challenges in the education sector such as difficulty in accessing education and a deteriorating learning environment. The Syrian crisis has exacerbated long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, demand and management. Securing a sustainable energy pathway for Jordan is more critical today than ever. As per the latest statistics, electricity consumption in the northern governorates (those mostly affected by the Syrian crisis) showed an additional increase of 2.3 per cent compared to other governorates in Jordan. 

This project aims to contribute to the overall efforts aiming at mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in line with the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) focusing on the Northern governorates (Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid, and North of Balqa’a Governorates) that are most affected by the Syrian crisis. This will be achieved through the use of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems to reduce the growing energy demands improve the learning environment in schools, increase enrollment and retention of Jordanian and Syrian students, improving the livelihood of surrounding communities and promote the social cohesion at the same time. 

Providing the schools with innovative techniques to reduce expenditure in energy bills and generate income will greatly relieve the ministry of the financial burden as well as allowing students, regardless of geographic location and nationality access to a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum academic achievement.

WOMEN’S ACTION GROUP PROFILE

1.	Background
Women’s Action Group (WAG) was founded in 1983. It was the violation of the human rights of black women by a black government which gave birth to this organisation. WAG was formed following the arrest and incarceration of over 6 000 women from October to December 1983 under Operation Clean up and its purpose was to round up single women and charge them as prostitutes. Thousands of women were arrested and detained. It was the arbitrary arrest and denial of freedom for the women of Zimbabwe that saw a handful of ordinary women taking up the fight against injustice. Since then, WAG never looked back on advocating for women’s rights. The organisation was registered as an Educational Trust in 1987 and has gained consultative status with the United Nations’ Economic and Consultative Social Council (ECOSOC). 
1.1 Vision
WAG’s vision is a Zimbabwe with empowered women and girls claiming and enjoying their rights in a situation of transformed power relations between women and men. The core purpose of the organisation is to champion women’s rights in Zimbabwe.
1.2 Mission statement
WAG’s mission statement is to develop products and tools for unlocking women’s power to claim and enjoy their rights in violence free and rights conscious communities.  The main programme areas for WAG include HIV & AIDS, Sexual reproductive health and rights and Gender based violence. 
1.3 Core purpose
   WAG’s core purpose is to champion women’s rights in Zimbabwe.

2.	Programme thematic areas
2.1 HIV AND AIDS
The programme advocates for specific   HIV and AIDS policies that are sensitive to the needs of women and girls as well as empowering them to assert their rights to safer sex to prevent HIV infection   
Objectives 
•	To raise awareness among communities particularly women and girls on  HIV and AIDS , gender and negative cultural practices increasing women’s vulnerability to HIV and AIDS
•	To advocate for policies on HIV and AIDS, that are sensitive to the specific needs of women and that promote quality health service provision for women
•	To empower women through information sharing to assert their right to safer sex to prevent HIV infection
•	To actively participate in national, regional and international processes on HIV and AIDS and articulate the concerns of women, as part of the global response to HIV and AIDS

2.2 GENDER BASED VIOLENCE

The programme touches on all aspects of women’s lives (public and private domain). The battle to free women from violence is fought on many angles including legislative reform, legal advice, counselling and representation and awareness raising campaigns. 
Objectives
•	To increase national awareness on the negative impact of gender based violence on women and girls.
•	To empower communities  particularly women to fight and prevent gender based violence in their lives
•	To advocate for policies and laws that address gender inequalities and gender based violence
•	To contribute to international, regional and national strategies and interventions to eradicate gender based violence
2.3 SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RIGHTS  
WAG is focusing on the Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights programme to promote strategies that respect the sexual and reproductive health rights and needs of women and girls.
Objectives
•	To promote gender equality in sexual and reproductive health and rights
•	To lobby for access to quality health care services in Zimbabwe
•	To raise community awareness and encourage them to come up initiatives and strategies that promote sexual and reproductive health and rights
•	To contribute to national, regional and international strategies and interventions to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights
2.4 AREAS OF OPERATION
All the three programmes operate at community and national level. WAG engages in awareness raising campaigns and training on addressing the intersections of HIV, gender based violence and women’s rights. WAG engages communities in dialogue on issues that affect them and come up with their own initiatives and solutions that promote the enjoyment of women’s rights. 
WAG also focuses on lobbying and advocacy for gender sensitive laws and policies. The organisations also works closely with the policy makers (the women’s caucus, parliamentary portfolio on health) to ensure that they commit to the international and regional instruments on women’s rights that Zimbabwe has ratified.

3.	Technical expertise
Women’s Action Group has experience in the field of gender equality and gender-based violence programming having worked in 26 Districts under the Integrated Support Programme (ISP) on prevention of GBV. Under the same programme, WAG demonstrated its expertise in capacity building through training of Behaviour Change Facilitators (BCFs) on integrating GBV in HIV programming in 13 Districts. WAG also made an input into the GBV training manual that was developed for BCFs. WAG has also demonstrated its training expertise through multi-sectoral training in 26 ISP Districts that resulted in the development of District level referral pathways for the 26 Districts. WAG has also developed training material for other programmes on gender equality such as the training manual for Community Based Advocates under the UN Women H4+ programme and has also developed GBV training manuals for training of service providers, civil society organisations and Community Based Advocates under the Amplify Change programme. WAG also has dedicated staff who have technical expertise in gender equality programming. Of particular interest has been WAG’s contribution to national priorities and its commitment to preventing GBV as one of its key strategic objectives under the current and past organisation strategic frameworks.
One of WAG’s flagship that has been championed over the years has been the production of booklets and the Speak Out magazine which requires fluency in both English and Shona as well as writing and editorial expertise. Through the production of other materials such as training manuals, WAG has also improved their ability to write concisely and produce material that has been shared globally through the website and other media channels. 
Other key competencies 
WAG believes that with teamwork the organisation can achieve greater results as individuals have diverse expertise. WAG also has respect for diversity having worked with diverse groups of people across ethnic backgrounds and lifestyles. The current programmes on gender equality requires WAG to have the aptitude to fit in different societies with different cultures and religions such as the Tonga people, apostolic sects, sex workers and persons with disabilities while maintaining respect of their differences.  WAG also values communication as a key component in coordinating programmes and have reputable communication structures with its partners. WAG has a good track record in delivering programme objectives and this has been demonstrated through its commitment to achieving results in all programmes undertaken.

SANPUD is a registered non-profit organisation (NPO-213-268) 
SANPUD is a registered public penefit organistion (9592690185)

Vision:
SANPUD envisions a world where:
1.	all people are able and empowered to make well-informed, conscious, autonomous decisions about their bodies, without being criminalised, stigmatised or excluded;
2.	A drug policy landscape that does not perpetuate the oppression, marginalisation and economic exclusion of people, including those who use drugs
3.	the response to drug use, lifestyles or identity does not increase harm, restrict people’s access to education, economic opportunity, services and medications or restrict their autonomy. 
Aim: 
A South Africa where drug policy aligns with our constitution. A country where people who use drugs are no longer criminalised, and enjoy the same rights guaranteed to all South Africans.
Objectives: 
1.	To support and establish a legitimate, coordinated and collective voice for people who use drugs and ensure their participation in developing policies, legislation, and research. 
2.	To facilitate the establishment, capacitation of peer-led regional networks that advocate for the rights and appropriate responses to people who use drugs at community, metropolitan and provincial levels.
3.	To contribute to dismantling the stigmatising and inaccurate narratives that dominate the discourse around drug use and the response to people who use drugs.
4.	To advocate for harm reduction services, interventions and approaches for people who use drugs as the standard response in health and social services and across the criminal justice system for people who inject drugs.
5.	To advocate for the rights of people who use drugs at the national, regional and international levels.
6.	To establish partnerships, collaborations, and projects with business, civil society, and government to benefit people who use drugs.
7.	To hold society and national and regional governments accountable for the preventable harms inflicted on people who use drugs due to current policies, legislative frameworks.
Activities:
1.	Work with the existing networks to develop guidelines, principles and positions to inform the purpose, role and activities of local people who use drugs networks. 
2.	Strengthen and expand existing relationships with National Government, the Central Drug Authority, academic institutions and national role-players.
3.	Gain support for effective drug policies, harm reduction and the decriminalisation of people who use drugs.
4.	Advocate for and ensure the involvement of people who use drugs in developing policies, laws, and interventions that impact people who use drugs. This aligns with the principle of “nothing about us, without us” 
5.	Identify and secure resources for the local networks and capacitate them to successfully apply for donor funds. 
6.	Develop and enter into memoranda of understanding and cooperation with appropriate and supportive organisations at a national level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7.	SANPUD will hold organisations providing services for people who use drugs accountable. SANPUD will ensure people are treated with dignity, afforded their privileges and rights, and not misrepresented or excluded.
8.	Ensure that appropriate skills are transferred or developed to enable the networks to move towards independent operations, including administration, management, planning and research.
9.	Design and conduct relevant, accurate, and valuable research to inform policy, strategies, and interventions.
10.	Use the research and advocacy agenda to focus efforts and provide structure for the processes and activities during the early development of the people who use drugs networks.

information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; or 4) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations. When examining information

A set of activities/outputs to achieve an objective within a budget and time frame.",0,0,KE,"TradeMark Africa (TMA), formerly TradeMark East Africa, is an Aid-for-Trade organisation that was established in 2010, with the aim of growing prosperity through increased trade. TMA operates on a not-for-profit basis and is funded by: Belgium, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. TMA works closely with regional intergovernmental organisations, including the African Union (AU), the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, the East African Community (EAC), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), national Governments, the private sector and civil society organisations.

The first two strategic periods of TMA (2010-2023) have contributed to substantial gains for trade and regional integration in East Africa and the Horn of Africa in terms of decreased cargo transit times (reduction of 16.5% on the Northern Corridor from Mombasa to Bujumbura), improved border efficiency (the time to cross targeted one stop border posts has been reduced by an average of 70%), and reduced barriers to trade. The continental-wide shift and rebrand to TMA was officially launched in West Africa in January 2023, with Ghana being the first country of operations in the region.

While continuing to leverage our core expertise in trade facilitation, we will evolve our focus to harness the potential of digitalisation, support African exporters to pioneer low carbon trade, address the core trade factors behind food security and promote inclusive trade. By increasing trade volumes, and enhancing the sustainability and inclusiveness of trade, we aim to deliver large-scale job creation, poverty reduction and enhanced economic growth.

In 2022, TMA set up a catalytic finance fund, Trade Catalyst Africa (TCA), that will pilot commercially viable projects for creating trade infrastructure (both physical and digital) as well as increasing access to Trade Finance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

TMA's headquarters are in Nairobi, Kenya. Operations and offices are in: EAC Secretariat - Arusha, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somaliland, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

It evolved out of a commitment to women’s rights within and outside the home, working with a feminist perspective and a human rights approach. MASUM’s primary belief is that people can resolve their own problems collectively with some amount of external support; thus, rather than create dependence on itself, MASUM focused on strengthening people’s perspectives on democracy, equality, secularism and social justice. 
In order to emphasis people’s participation in decision-making at every level, the staff is mostly local, especially women from marginalised sections of rural society. Leadership building from subordinated groups since its inception helped to build a strong second line leadership; thereby MASUM meticulously avoided the pitfall of founders handing over the organization to their children or family members.
MASUM’s community level involvement is primarily with rural women in perennially drought- prone areas of Pune and Ahmednagar districts of Maharashtra state. Acknowledging that women are not a homogenous category and that multiple systems of domination - such as caste, class, religion and patriarchy operate in an intersectional manner, MASUM predominantly works with subordinated and minority-groups. 
Some of MASUM’s on-going activities include women's right to health and savings and credit programme (SHGs), addressing gender-based violence, building a progressive perspective among young people, and enhancing their rights in all areas of life. Political participation of women, both as elected representatives and as empowered citizens, strengthening of child rights through village-based children’s councils (Bal Panchayats), and enhancing women’s right to property ownership are ongoing interventions too. Men are encouraged to participate in MASUM’s work, with women taking on leadership roles. Every programme of MASUM is interconnected with another, so that people’s human rights are realised in multiple ways.
At the state and national levels, we are committed to training and capacity building of NGOs, CBOs and a variety of stakeholders in increasing people’s access to economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights. MASUM is recognised as a credible training institute on gender, health rights, ESC rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), violence against women (VAW), and dalit and minority rights. We are also involved with campaigns and networks that strengthen women’s rights from the local to the international levels.

The principle of ""leaving no one behind"", enshrined in the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Plan for Financing for Development, is at the heart of the overall ""Road to 2030"" strategy, which is built around four interconnected priority themes:

- improving access to quality basic social services;
- strengthening the socio-economic integration of women and young people;

Identifying that food is the best medicine, they believed that developing small-scale agriculture is the key to reducing rural poverty. In 1987, Farm Africa started work with nomadic pastoralists in the remote north of Kenya, expanding to Ethiopia a year later.  

Farm Africa believes that Africa has the power to feed itself and that its smallholders hold the key to lasting rural prosperity. We work directly with farmers to help them unleash their potential to feed Africa’s people.  We pioneer techniques that boost harvests, reduce poverty, sustain natural resources and help end Africa’s need for aid.  

Farm Africa has 200 staff operating across the east African countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.  Farm Africa’s local staff provide the tools and expertise to enable smallholders in eastern Africa to increase their harvests, whether they farm crops, livestock, fish or the forest.  We train them to be more commercial, adding value to surpluses by milling, drying, or turning their produce into products that fetch a higher price.  With better food for their families and reliable incomes from their businesses, farmers can build for the future.

We work with communities of people living with HIV, regardless of whether they are geographic or identity based, to challenge governments and global leaders to improve access and quality of essential HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.

We have created different evidence gathering tools to support networks of people living with HIV and HIV community activists in their advocacy. The tools use the methodology of learning-by-doing, empowering people living with HIV with knowledge and skills and building the capacity of our partners.
Using the power of evidence-based advocacy we can improve the HIV response and the lives of people living with HIV. In different countries the tools have been instrumental to policy change. For example, in Malawi the results of the PLHIV Stigma Index has lead to a new first-line antiretroviral treatment.

Our mission is to empower rural Africa to achieve economic independence - and on a continent where up to 75% of people rely on small-scale agriculture for their survival, we believe that it is only by tackling the challenges faced by rural farming communities that real and sustained economic progress can be made across sub-Saharan Africa.

For more than 25 years, Self Help Africa has sought to strengthen agricultural systems, improve access to services and inputs, and provide rural African communities with the opportunities to market and sell their produce.

Self Help Africa works with local staff and partners in nine countries, supporting communities to grow more food, diversify their farm production, develop new off-farm enterprise, and sell their surpluses.

We support rural micro-finance programmes, assist producers to organise into farmers associations and co-operatives, enable farm families to access markets and add value to their produce, and promote low-cost sustainable solutions to the management of natural resources, to community adaption to a changing climate, and to the challenges of gender inequality.

Self Help Africa is also committed to advocating in support of the interests of African smallholder farmers, to ensure that there is a long-term commitment to aid and investment, to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture and food production in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

Self Help Africa was formed in 2008 from a merger between two like-minded charities: UK NGO Harvest Help and Irish agency Self Help Development International. Both charities were founded in mid-1980s in response to the catastrophic Ethiopian famine and the droughts that plagued many central African countries.",None available,0,0,21,No segmentation.

It is an independent Think Tank and a network.
There is now abundant evidence to show that past and current efforts at identifying and implementing solutions that are handed down from outside and are not rooted in the history and culture of Africa have faced some difficulties.
Ownership of these solutions by African countries and populations has repeatedly failed to take root and as the result such solutions have not achieved their full potential and, in some cases, they have done more harm than good.

At continental and country level, ACHEST aspires to strategically promote and advocate for the use of well grounded knowledge and evidence to strengthen professionals and build institutional capacity that will provide transformational leadership to African communities, countries and the world.

ACHEST applies constructive and targeted strategic communication at all levels to catalyze the needed behavior change that will result in stronger ownership and implementation capacity for proven interventions and better health for Africa's people.
To achieve this, ACHEST forges strategic alliances and partnerships with individuals and organizations within Africa and around the world.  It is within this premise that the current partnership in HSA4A is built.

sci,Save the Children International,0,quarterly,0,0,"Save the Children delivers life-saving assistance to children whose need is greatest, wherever they are. This means we work in some of the most complex, insecure, and fast-changing environments in the world, and as such the safety and security of our people and partners is paramount. Any information that compromises this – and merely confirming our presence in certain locations may be enough to do this – is excluded from our IATI publications. This means that some fields may be excluded on some activities. As a rights-based organisation we have a commitment to safeguard children, especially those with whom we are in contact. Therefore we will not publish any information that could identify any individual. More information can be found in our Child Safeguarding Policy.

This does, however, mean it may differ from the high-quality, audited information that we share through our Annual Report.

In our internal systems, multi-country grants and contracts are set up as internal ‘funding streams’ with ‘child’ awards for each country. We do this in order to facilitate financial reconciliations between country offices. Due to the way information is held within our systems, ‘parent’ funding streams and their child awards are all published as separate IATI activities, with their relationship indicated using IATI’s ‘related activity’ elements. The parent funding stream IATI activity will not have certain fields/elements (description, sector, recipient-country/region, document-link and records of expenditure). These are published on the child award’s IATI activity file only. Our systems do not easily map against the IATI categories for completion / post-completion, therefore we have adopted ‘implementation’ to cover all award activity (e.g. programme activity may have ended but financial reconciliation, etc. is still ongoing). Therefore in some instances an award status may display as ‘implementation’ even after its planned end date.",21,"The majority of data is published as a single activities file, not segmented by country or region.",cc-by,active,Data is published within three months of end of quarter.

Yet our experience has shown that by connecting, partnering and collaborating with all players, it is possible to reconcile social and ecological responsibilities with supply chain and market realities.

The nature of courses on offer is based on market demand and through on-going evaluation with our target group of young people aged 15-25. Course content is made up of over 70% practical training and 30% trade-related theory training. Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is integrated with Life Skills and Entrepreneurship education. Where available, our courses are linked to government vocational training systems, or accredited by relevant local authorities. Each semester, students who pass their exams receive their certificates at festive graduation ceremonies. Our integrated TVET has evolved over the years and is now being delivered in three different models: centre-based, mobile outreach and industry-attached.
At our six centres, young people participate in the integrated TVET training programme for periods ranging from 8 weeks to 12 months depending on the course and level. The 70% practical exposure is made possible by our unique Franchise Model whereby all courses are franchised to local entrepreneurs who pay rent for the use of YA facilities, equipment and brand name, while also training our students on-the-job. The curriculum is defined, and the quality of education controlled, by Young Africa staff. Life Skills education and Entrepreneurship training form a part of the curriculum.
In response to the growing demand for TVET and employability programmes among disadvantaged young people in marginalised, remote and outlying areas, YA Zimbabwe has been implementing an outreach TVET programme where a mobile unit comprising equipment, trainers and training consumables moves from one remote site to the other delivering 12 week-long TVET programmes, fully integrated with entrepreneurship development and Life Skills education. After training, students undertake an attachment and, where necessary, YA offers post-training support such as linking graduates with micro-financing institution.
Industry-attached training
This new approach to delivering TVET was piloted by Young Africa Namibia in 2015 as a way to influence channelling of corporate social responsibility resources towards job-related skills training. Young Africa joins forces with leading local industries with interest in offering job-related skills training at their industrial sites. Through this model, small groups of up to six unemployed young people receive practical job-related skills training over a certain number of days per week at the industrial site for period of up to three months. During the three-month period, Young Africa joins in to offer Life Skills education and Entrepreneurship skills training to this group of students. Trainees do not pay for their training. All training costs are borne by the training company. The company pays Young Africa a fee for conducting Life Skills and Entrepreneurship training.
Want to know more about our unique method?
YA HUB offers various training packages in youth work, life skills education, entrepreneurship, organisation sustainability and more. Training can be facilitated in-house, at the Young Africa HUB in Harare, Zimbabwe, or at your specific location.

In line with principles of transparency and accountability, Free a girl commits to publishing project data on IATI as of January 2016. More information about IATI and its objectives is available on the IATI website.

Free a Girl is first focusing on publishing data on projects receiving funding from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Data from projects with other funding sources and donors are therefore excluded from publication at this stage.  

Free a Girl adheres to the principle of ‘Open, unless…’, whereby data on project activities are excluded from publication on IATI if the information falls under one of the following categories: 

1.	Projects that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Netherlands
Free a Girl publishes all projects funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other projects and programmes are not published in the beginning. This policy will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. 
2.	Safety and security 
If the information disclosed could reasonably pose a threat to the safety and security of any individuals, such as project beneficiaries, partner organisations, Free a Girl staff or donors, it is excluded. This could include but is not limited to, specific locations of project activities and addresses of local partner offices and so forth. 
3.	Harmful for project activities 
Information that would cause harm or jeopardise the implementation or success of project activities is not disclosed. Given the work of Free a Girl in the area of commercial sexual exploitation, this could include information, for example, about targets of future rescue raid operations or advocacy activities.  
4.	External relations
Free a girl does not publish information that may negatively affect relationships with partner organisations, donors and other key stakeholders. Partner organisations and back donors related to projects that are published on IATI are informed of Free a Girl’s policies for publishing project data and can request exclusion. 

5.	Confidentiality and privacy
Information that can be traced to an individual, constitutes an invasion of privacy, or may be confidential due to legal, commercial or contractual reasons, is not disclosed. 
6.	Cost-effectiveness 
Free a Girl does not publish data where the time or monetary costs of obtaining and publishing the data outweigh the expected social impact or public benefit. 
7.	History
Free a Girl publishes data from projects funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that commenced after 30 June 2015. Projects prior to this date and that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are excluded at this stage. 

Reviews and decision-making 
A review of this exclusion policy is conducted on a quarterly basis by the programmes manager and staff, in order to keep abreast of new requirements and changes in internal policies. Decision-making regarding publication of data and exclusions is done by the programmes manager and the director, with assistance from projects staff.

It has been operational since 2008 and has run over fifteen projects through use of the power of the law, policy dialogue, pro-bono court representation, legal, capacity building of justice law and order agencies, legal outreaches and legal empowerment related to integration of national and international human rights approaches within the framework of Sustainable Development Goals and UN Guidelines on Business and Human Rights. The core focus has been on vulnerable communities who are host to extractive resources such as minerals, oil and gas. In the same context we focus national players and decision makers through training and capacity building and push for policy reform. The key issues at the center of our work are gender equality in extractive resource use, compensation and resettlement, corporate accountability, protecting the environment amidst oil, gas and mining activities, reform of the law and policy to match new and emerging natural resource extraction and user challenges, ensuring that the poor and vulnerable access justice and remedy for their grievances.

ANARDE runs three programs that is, the Legal Aid Program, Nature Conservation and Extractive Justice Programs. Under its legal aid program, it collects complaints from communities worst affected by natural resource use, undertakes policy research and advocacy, legal advisory to marginalized people and those affected by development projects, as well as strategic and public interest litigation. The organization undertakes capacity building of local communities and vulnerable populations to actualize their legal entitlements. We have also trained judicial officers (lower and upper bench) and practicing lawyers on with the framework of Business and Human Rights standards governing extractive activities especially in the Albertine Grabben and Karamoja Sub Region.

The Extractive Justice Program serves to check the excesses of Mining and oil companies, capacity building of communities on rights, justice, participation, transparency and accountability in the sector. 

The nature Conservation program serves to monitor and identify environmental challenges to sensitive ecosystems, action against climate change and policy reforms.

We work across society and borders to challenge the causes and address the consequences of massive human rights violations. We affirm victims’ dignity, fight impunity, and promote responsive institutions to lay the foundations for peace, justice and inclusion. 

Throughout its 17-year history, ICTJ provided intense advice assistance to support truth seeking processes, including truth commissions in Timor-Leste, Peru, and Sierra Leone; provided time-critical support to criminal justice efforts in Guatemala and Argentina; led efforts to ensure victims played a role in policy deliberations in Uganda, Morocco, and Iraq; and devised a massive mapping exercises of human rights violations in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Lebanon. More recently, ICTJ made vital contributions to the Colombian peace process, working to introduce an integrated transitional justice approach to key stakeholders that is reflected in the peace accords. ICTJ continues to play a trusted role in implementing the accords. In Tunisia, ICTJ supported the national consultation process, the drafting of the transitional justice law, and the establishment and capacity of the Truth and Dignity Commission. ICTJ’s work alongside activists in northern Uganda to help end stigma against children born of wartime rape and their mothers has resulted in a significant shift in attitudes in communities and pledges of support from international donors.

is a development, social research, and implementation consultancy firm that has designed and implemented impactful services and solutions in humanitarian and development settings since 2010. We bring diverse, cutting-edge, and in-country experience across the Monitoring, Evaluation, Research, and Learning (MERL), and capacity-building realms. Our goal is to provide our partners with services that are evidence-based and with a deep understanding of the social, economic, cultural, and political contexts in which they work, to improve development outcomes and humanization outreach globally. 

•	Research Rigor. At our core, we are a group of dynamic data scientists and research professionals. Our expertise covers all aspects of data collection, including quantitative and qualitative research design, sampling, questionnaire and interview guide formulation, scripting on data collection platforms, recruitment and training of staff, management of fieldwork staff, data processing, and data analysis and reporting. We also put in place strong quality control protocols, by ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data collected during research. This includes conducting thorough reviews, implementing quality control measures, reviewing tools and procedures, conducting data cleaning and validation checks, and providing training and support to field staff.   

•	Large-Scale Data Collection and Outreach Activities. We are experts at rapidly mobilizing teams for large and mega-sized enumeration projects. We possess the organizational capacity to handle a wide array of enumeration exercises, including fielding nationwide surveys covering hard-to-reach populations. We use robust data collection tools, which are highly scalable and enable the gathering of geospatial information.

•	Expertise with Vulnerable Populations. Through years of experience, we have developed expertise in working with vulnerable, under-served, and hard-to-reach populations. Our well-trained team has the knowledge and capability to work sensitively with refugees, displaced populations, children, people with disabilities, and other social minorities.

•	Programmatic M&E and TPM. Our technical team has extensive experience in conducting monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and third-party monitoring (TPM) for projects, starting from developing the theory of change to Data Quality Assessments (DQA) to performing the data collection and monitoring activities. We work with organizations to operationalize their M&E plans, first by advising on the best data sources for measuring outcomes, and then through data collection at every project stage: baseline, midline, and end-line.

•	Continuous Learning and Improvement. We have tested and deployed powerful tools and methods to track progress and improvement in real time. This enables our clients to track data and progress on a specific effort or intervention to ensure their interventions are actively monitored, continuously improved, and possibly scaled if success is evident. 

•	Implementation Excellence. We are experts at rapidly mobilizing teams for large projects. We possess the organizational capacity to handle a wide array of technical and management exercises, including fielding staff nationwide and engaging hard-to-reach populations. We have tested and deployed powerful tools and methods to track progress and improvement in real time. This is to ensure interventions are actively monitored, continuously improved, and possibly scaled if success is evident.
  
•	Capacity Building. We are focused on advancing and growing the research and data-driven sectors wherever we work. We engage our clients and beneficiaries in a collaborative, interactive training process and come away from our capacity-building events with practical new skills and targeted knowledge.  

•	Responsive Management. Serving as responsive and valuable partners to our clients is at the apex of our mandate and is the driving force behind our success. We often serve as a go-to in-country partner, providing a range of solutions, including administrative functions like implementing large-scale interventions and activities and organizing complex events. 
 
•	Geographic Presence. Mindset is incorporated in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Nigeria, and Ukraine. We also operate through field staff and affiliate offices in Lebanon and Tunisia. We are able to mobilize in almost any setting or context if given the appropriate set-up time, even if we have not operated previously. This is due to our agile approach to setting up operations and vast international network of consultants and partners.

Our mission is to translate scientific discoveries into affordable, globally accessible public health solutions.

Through scientific and clinical research in Africa, India, Europe, and the U.S., IAVI is pioneering the development of biomedical innovations designed for broad global access. We develop vaccines and antibodies in and for the developing world and seek to accelerate their introduction in low-income countries.

IAVI programs and partnerships are grounded in the regions of the world where the disease burden is the greatest, and our approach emphasizes sustainability. Our network of clinical research center partners in Africa and India helps strengthen in-country research capacity and supports the training and education of the next generation of scientists. The global impact of our science includes fundamental contributions to understanding the biology of HIV infection, which IAVI and others are applying toward advancing vaccine science and immunology.

IAVI accelerates scientific discovery and development by fostering unique collaborations among academia, industry, local communities, governments, and funders to explore new and better ways to address public health threats that disproportionately affect people living in poverty.

Our global reach, including a clinical research network in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in India, has allowed us to make fundamental contributions to understanding the epidemiology, transmission, virology, and immunology of HIV. This work played a key role in facilitating the design of promising HIV vaccine candidates, as well as the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies that are now being advanced as promising approaches for HIV prevention. Our integrated capabilities in vaccine and antibody discovery, development, and clinical research take advantage of biopharmaceutical industry expertise to accelerate the development and testing of prevention methods for HIV and other diseases. Through the Product Development Center, we support external researchers with technical and scientific expertise to accelerate the development of their own products.",0,0,0,21,0,odc-by,active,0

We believe organisations deliver higher quality, more effective aid when they are accountable to the people they serve.

Together, we are a movement to strengthen accountability and to put people affected by crisis at the heart of what we do by implementing the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS).

The Alliance was formed in 2015 by bringing together the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP) International, which focused on accountability to affected people, and People in Aid, which focused on people management in the humanitarian aid and development sectors. We are headquartered in Geneva and maintain a presence in London.

Together, we have more than two decades of experience in supporting the sector in applying standards and good practices.

The Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS) serves as an important reference point for the work of CHS Alliance. Other organisations that provide important CHS-related products and services include Sphere, Groupe URD and the Humanitarian Quality Assurance Initiative (HQAI).

It is important to note, however, that the Global Fund is currently undergoing a revision of its grant architecture. A core feature of the new Global Fund grant architecture is the “single stream of funding per Principal Recipient per disease.” Whereas under the current system, each newly approved proposal results in a separate grant agreement with its own budget, performance framework, etc. under the new Architecture, the Global Fund will maintain one funding agreement for each Principal Recipient per disease, which will then be amended when a new proposal for funding the same disease is approved. 

This Architecture change will not affect the level of data publication, but will mean a fewer number of data points. (For more information, please see http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en).

The Global Fund does not have multi-tiered project structures.
",N/A,Data will be listed as “verified”.,CH,0,N/A,0,"The Global Fund has a performance-based funding model, which ensures that funding decisions are based on a transparent assessment of results against time-bound targets. In the Global Fund context, performance is therefore recognised as a predictor of future disbursements and acknowledged as an important variable in predictable financing. This issue particularly pertains to annual budgets, which are adjusted according to country performance and planned disbursements, which are calculated on the basis of past performance and expected results, and are adjusted on the basis of a transparent assessment of results against time-bound targets.

Moreover, data found in the Data Catalog is unit-level data based on Global Fund grant information.  Data at the grant level may not be aggregated to obtain higher-level data (i.e. country or regional levels).  Aggregation of data will in some cases result in double counting and produce inaccurate figures.  In order to obtain accurate higher-level data about Global Fund activities, please refer to figures published by the Global Fund at http://portfolio.theglobalfund.org/?lang=en.

Op lange termijn streven we naar duurzame en rechtvaardige samenlevingen waar iedereen goed leeft met genoeg en er rekening wordt gehouden met de grenzen van onze planeet. Omdat er meer nodig is dan verfraaiingswerk, wordt systeemverandering de rode draad in onze strategie, met sociale en ecologische rechtvaardigheid als transversaal principe, toegepast op 3 domeinen van verandering: grondstoffen en voedselsystemen, wereldwijde solidariteit in beweging en politieke stem en participatie.

Verandering is mogelijk als mensen samen kiezen voor inclusie en participatie. Daarom verbinden we gemeenschappen in Vlaanderen en de partnerlanden in een wereldwijde solidaire beweging met een positief en sterk ethisch verhaal van delen en herverdelen. Zo komen we tot een internationale samenwerking die ‘Noord en Zuid’ als tegenstelling achter zich laat. Weliswaar niet blind voor de ongelijke verdeling van de nefaste gevolgen van onrechtvaardige machtsstructuren. Daarom is er specifieke aandacht voor wie hard getroffen wordt. De realiteit is dat dit hoofdzakelijk in de partnerlanden is.

Politiek werk staat voorop om het beleid te veranderen, zowel in de partnerlanden als in België. Daarvoor is een draagvlak nodig. Verandering groeit vanaf de basis. Via ons brede netwerk sensibiliseren en mobiliseren we de Vlaamse samenleving voor internationale solidariteit. Met bewegingswerk en educatie stimuleren we kritische analyse, sociale actie en structurele verandering. Creatieve modellen, de kracht van ontmoetingen, vormingstrajecten en pittige debatten prikkelen van jongs af tot verbondenheid in het perspectief van meer solidariteit. We komen in zo’n 60% van de Vlaamse scholen en werken actiegericht met duizenden vrijwilligers in ruim 1500 lokale groepen en met partnerorganisaties in 11 landen.

At national level, the national networks assume responsibility and ownership of their programme with technical support from the regional secretariat. WANEP principles emphasize ownership of peacebuilding practice. Given that the national networks understand their situation and realities , they are in a better position to engage their communities and government and intervene effectively. Our national networks facilitate a more bottom-up approach and allow their intervention to reflect the peculiarities of the issues of human security in their various countries.

At regional level, it is acknowledged that factors that fuel conflicts and their escalation in our sub-region are no respecters of artificially-imposed boundaries. Our regional programmes cut across national networks and are designed to increase leverage in engaging diverse actors at regional and international level.

The mission of the Agência do Zambeze, which was established in 2010, is to promote the socio-economic and sustainable development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. This Basin comprises 34 districts in four provinces: Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezi. In addition to these districts the Agency’s geographical remit also comprise 6 districts that fall outside the River Basin area. 

Following Decree No. 23/2010 of June 2010 the ZVDA is mandated to act in three areas:

•	Undertake studies and present strategies for the socio-economic development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. 
•	Provide technical and financial assistance to socio-economic development initiatives in the Lower Zambezi River Basin, including mobilizing funds for such initiatives and channelling them to beneficiaries. 
•	Provide support to local governments in local land use planning and socio-economic development

The management of the Agency has taken the strategic decision to facilitate, rather than to implement development projects. By means of national and international tenders, public and private partners are invited to apply to undertake the projects. To a limited extent, ZVDA staff or consultants are charged with project management tasks.

The Agency seeks to play a decisive role in coordinating the relationship between the partners, funders, implementing agencies and beneficiaries. Therefore, information collection and sharing, supervision and monitoring of projects and programmes are key tasks.

",0,0,US-EIN-95-3202116,"World Vision is currently publishing two separate types of data on the Registry related to its Field Offices (which implement our programs) and Support Offices (which contribute funding to programs). For its Field Offices, World Vision International publishes on behalf of its Field Offices their expenditure by sector and disaggregated by financial year and whether the programming is categorized as ‘development’ or ‘humanitarian’. Each field office is covered by one activity. For Support Offices, each institutional grant is the unit of aid and is largely dependent on the donor, sectors, recipient country, etc. Grant data should link clearly to the field activities, showing how those grants are part of a wider programming portfolio in that country. Multi-country grants and grants held by consortia of offices within World Vision are all published as single activities. Where World Vision is a member of a consortium led by another agency, that lead agency which distributes the funds on behalf of the consortium is identified as the donor.","World Vision excludes information where a) there are security concerns, in order to protect those working in sensitive geographic environments, b) information may be politically or culturally sensitive and c) funding partners specify that they should be excluded. More details on information that can be made available to the public is in World Vision’s Open Information policy here: https://www.wvi.org/publication/open-information-policy. Currently we do not publish information about programming in North Korea, Sudan and Jordan (as this includes much of our Syria programming). We allocate field office overhead costs proportionately to the sector programmes they support and also currently exclude costs directly associated with the child sponsorship administration process, though we keep under review the clearest way to communicate how we allocate programme resources.","World Vision’s approaches IATI as an open data initiative. The data published undergoes a rigorous process of internal validation before it is posted on the registry. The data is not yet comprehensive of all of World Vision’s operations, given the above mentioned exclusions and occasions when accurate and complete data is not yet available, and so there may be some differences with other published financial data. World Vision International’s annual Accountability Report provides fuller financial data and discloses the proportion of funds on programming, fundraising, and administrative costs, along with other information that enables stakeholders to hold World Vision to account in fulfilling its promises. ",US,"World Vision is a global Christian relief, development and advocacy organization dedicated to working with children, families and communities to overcome poverty and injustice.

ILO does not have a system in place yet to do it for assessed contributions. Development voluntary funding (projects) that was partly repurposed for humanitarian response in emergency situations does not get flagged as humanitarian in ILO data due to technical limitations. Hence possible discrepancies compared to the data reported to OCHA FTS.

Operating nationwide, it strives to promote equitable and sustainable development, humanitarian response, and other relevant interventions aimed at improving the quality of life and wellbeing of communities and individuals. The organization's approach is two-pronged and innovative. On one hand, BFD carries out multi-sectoral emergency response projects to address immediate humanitarian needs in nutrition, health, WASH, education, shelter, CCCM, protection, food security & livelihoods, and EECR sectors. On the other hand, it focuses on developmental empowerment and capacity building of local actors, underscoring the importance of transitioning swiftly from rapid response to resilience-building methods. This approach is crucial for communities to recover, rise again, and harness their capacities, starting with fostering peace through innovative measures.

BFD's programs, spanning various sectors like food security and livelihoods, nutrition and health, WASH, clean energy and environment, protection, education and child rights, shelter/NFI and camp management, economic empowerment, governance, and peace-building, operate in different geographies based on strategic and donor humanitarian response plans. The organization is a trusted partner of a wide array of UN agencies and donors, participating actively in national sectoral groups and international forums like Sphere, ICVA, CHS Alliance, and more.

We work in Africa, several parts of Asia, the South Caucasus, the Middle East and Latin America and have recently started work in the UK. Our policy work focuses on several key themes that influence prospects for peace and security – the economy, climate change, gender, the role of international institutions, the impact of development aid, and the effect of good and bad governance.

An aid ‘activity’ is a project, program, cash transfer, delivery of goods, training course, research project, debt relief operation, or a contribution to an international organization.","USAID does not exclude entire activities from IATI publication; instead, it removes specific fields per the policies below:

It is the policy of the U.S. Government, per OMB Bulletin 12-01, and the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016 (FATAA) for agencies to have a strong presumption in favor of openness. 
FATAA provides the following principled exceptions: 1) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; 2) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; 3) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; or 4) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations. When examining information that falls within these categories, USG agencies have sufficient flexibility to protect sensitive information from disclosure, on a case-by-case basis, in order to protect against potential harm while maintaining a strong presumption in favor of transparency. To ensure that these exceptions are rarely applied, and are used appropriately and consistent with the presumption of openness, USAID maintains  specific case-by-case justifications for all instances of reliance on the principled exceptions established in this section.
","USAID translates descriptive fields into French, Spanish, or Portuguese for activities where the recipient geographic country includes one of these languages as official. Translations of any materials into languages other than English are intended as a convenience to the non-English-reading public . USAID performs translations using a translation software service. Due to the nuances in translating to a foreign language, differences may exist. USAID does not own, manage, or control any aspect of the translation software. USAID does not warrant the accuracy or reliability of any translated information. ",US,"USAID Mission:  On behalf of the American people, we promote and demonstrate democratic values abroad, and advance a free, peaceful, and prosperous world. In support of America's foreign policy, the U.S. Agency for International Development leads the U.S. Government's international development and disaster assistance through partnerships and investments that save lives, reduce poverty, strengthen democratic governance, and help people emerge from humanitarian crises and progress beyond assistance.

Our objective is to support partners to become self-reliant and capable of leading their own development journeys. We make progress toward this by reducing the reach of conflict, preventing the spread of pandemic disease, and counteracting the drivers of violence, instability, transnational crime and other security threats. We promote American prosperity through investments that expand markets for U.S. exports; create a level playing field for U.S. businesses; and support more stable, resilient, and democratic societies. We stand with people when disaster strikes or crisis emerges as the world leader in humanitarian assistance.
","Published budget figures come from the Congressional Budget Justification - a document sent to Congress by the President in January or February of each year, as required by law (31 U.S.C. § 1105), requesting new budget authority for federal programs and estimating federal revenues and outlays for the upcoming fiscal year and 4 subsequent outyears. Although the title of the document is Budget of the U.S. Government, it represents proposals for congressional consideration. There is not a one-to-one link between budget figures and the financial data - commitments and disbursements - for a given year. The Congressional Budget Justification includes sectors specific to the U.S. Government.

All CERF allocation and contribution data available in its internal Grant Management System (GMS) is made available through a Web API. As of January 2016, all donor contributions to CERF, starting with the inception of the grant element in 2006, are available. Data on CERF allocations (in the form of grants and loans) is currently limited to 2014 onward pending the completion of data migration from a legacy IT system to the current GMS. ",US,"The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is one of the fastest and most effective ways to support rapid humanitarian response for people affected by natural disasters and armed conflict. CERF receives voluntary contributions year-round to provide immediate funding for life-saving humanitarian action anywhere in the world.

ERF pools contributions from donors – mainly governments, but also, foundations, companies, charities and individuals – into a single fund with a $450 million annual target.

This money is set aside for immediate use at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources.

In emergencies, humanitarian organizations apply jointly for funding. Funds are immediately released if these proposals meet CERF’s criteria, i.e. the needs are urgent and the proposed activities will save lives.

With money available immediately, relief organizations can deliver food, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other life-saving aid faster and more efficiently.

CERF allocations are designed to complement other humanitarian funding sources, such as country-based pooled funds and bilateral funding.

CERF makes money available when it is needed most: at the beginning of a crisis, when time is of the essence and it is critical that emergency relief operations get under way quickly.

But mobilizing funds can take time and as time passes, more lives are lost.
CERF helps to remedy this problem with rapid response grants, which can be approved in as little as 48 hours.

CERF provides funding to the world’s most neglected crises. When a disaster fades from the headlines, or never makes the headlines, it is much harder to raise funds. The need for help, however, is no less significant.

CERF helps to address this challenge with underfunded emergencies grants, which are disbursed twice a year for emergencies that have not attracted sufficient funding.

CERF has a loan facility of $30 million. Up to one-year loans are provided based on indication that donor funding is forthcoming.

In an average year, CERF allocates approximately $450 million to humanitarian operations in some 50 different countries. Since 2006, more than $3.7 billion has been allocated to help millions of people in 92 countries and territories across the world.

CERF funding is available to UN agencies, funds and programmes and the International Organization for Migration.

NGOs are important partners in the CERF allocation decision making processes and receive CERF funding when they carry out work for recipient organizations.

CERF is funded by voluntary contributions. Since 2006, CERF has received almost $3.8 billion from 125 UN Member States and observers, regional and local authorities, and other public and private donors. A third of CERF’s contributors have also received support from the fund.

The Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) manages CERF on behalf of the UN Secretary-General.

The ERC is supported by the CERF secretariat, which is situated within the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The CERF secretariat is responsible for ensuring that the funds are allocated properly, disbursed in a timely manner, and that use of the funds is reported appropriately and transparently.

The CERF Advisory Group provides policy guidance to the Secretary-General on the use and impact of the fund.",0,0,0,40,0,odc-by,active,Data is published as soon as it is entered in CERF's internal grant management system (GMS).

INPUD will achieve this through processes of empowerment and advocacy at the international level, while supporting empowerment and advocacy at community, national and regional levels.

INPUD is a global network that seeks to represent people who use drugs in international agencies such as the United Nations and with those undertaking international development work.

INPUD is committed to demonstrating at country level how people who use drugs can constructively contribute to the development and delivery of services for our community.

DRC fulfils its mandate by providing direct assistance to conflict-affected populations – refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs) and host communities in the conflict areas of the world; and by advocating on behalf of conflict-affected populations internationally, and in Denmark, on the basis of humanitarian principles and the Human Rights Declaration. We understand ""durable solutions"" as any means by which the situation of refugees can be permanently and satisfactorily resolved, enabling them to live normal lives. Durable solutions can be voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement. In Denmark, DRC assists refugees in all aspects of integration as well as asylum procedures. Internationally, DRC actively participates in supporting the protection of refugees, and promoting durable solutions for conflict-affected populations.

The DRC’s supreme authority is the Council, which consists of up to three representatives of each member organisation, six representatives of the voluntary groups and refugee counselling organisations cooperating with the Danish Refugee Council, and of the Executive Committee.
DRC is an umbrella organisation and is currently consisting of 30 organisation members and voluntary groups, committed to the refugee cause. Membership of the DRC is open to non-party-political, voluntary, nationwide humanitarian and international organisations that work on a democratic basis, and whose aims conform to those of the DRC.

Providing refugees, internally displaced persons and other affected groups in situations of war and conflict with assistance according to their rights. This assistance can consist of relief and other humanitarian aid, rehabilitation and support to return home, as well as contributions to the promotion of durable solutions
Contributing to capacity building and co-operation between local and national authorities, as well as other relevant organisations. This work aims at strengthening advocacy and promoting solutions to problems related to situations of conflict, particularly with a view to improving the protection and reintegration of refugees and internally displaced persons
Under its mandate, DRC International focuses on protection, relief, rehabilitation, post-conflict recovery, capacity-building, humanitarian mine-action, and advocacy. Over the years, DRC has developed particular expertise in relation to the following core sectors:

Food security & Agricultural rehabilitation and Development
Non-food items; Displacement-related Law and Information
Social Rehabilitation
Capacity Development of Duty-Bearers and NGOs (including networking)
Humanitarian Mine Action (DDG – Danish De-mining Group)

However, DRC also implements through local partners when this is the best way to meet DRC’s mandate and values. In such cases, DRC is committed to assist the implementing partner strengthen its accountability and capacity.

In recent years AVSI has gained deep experience in the fields of education, agriculture and food security. In the state of the Lakes, AVSI has been implementing food security projects since 2011 with particular attention to issues related to security and peacebuilding, components that have an important influence on the success of activities and on the general improvement of the context in which it operates. In Eastern Equatoria AVSI is one of the most operational organizations in the field of education; UNICEF's main partner, AVSI staff deals with projects that support the educational apparatus both from a structural point of view and from the point of view of teacher training and community awareness, one of the strengths of the organization. In addition, also in Eastern Equatoria, AVSI has now acquired a primary position also in the field of food security and agricultural development, supporting the most vulnerable families with emergency distributions while investing in local farmers with a view to strengthening the resilience and self-sufficiency of local communities. Although there is a particular focus on these two sectors, AVSI works for the holistic development of the person and his community, engaging in a multi-sectoral approach that has allowed the staff to acquire specific professional skills also in the field of nutrition, water and protection; these elements are always considered in the planning and implementation of project actions in such a way as to create synergies between different projects and create sustainability. Over the years, AVSI has built and strengthened links both with the local population – through village chiefs and traditional local authorities – and with institutional figures at the state and county levels. A constant and open dialogue with the beneficiaries of the projects has allowed AVSI to build, together with local actors, tailor-made solutions that respond in a particular way to the needs of the population, as demonstrated by the results produced by the emergency and resilience strengthening projects implemented in partnership with FAO (ERLP).",0,0,0,21,0,cc-by,active,0

History:

icddr,b was established in Dhaka in 1960s as the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) Cholera Research Laboratory. The Cholera Research Laboratory (CRL) soon developed an international reputation in diarrhoeal disease research. Among its notable early achievements was a key role in the development, testing and implementation of oral rehydration solution (ORS) – a treatment estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide.

During the 1960s, the CRL also established a large-scale health and demographic surveillance site at Matlab – now the longest-running such site in the global South and an inspiration for many similar sites worldwide. In 1962, the CRL established the Dhaka Hospital, still run by icddr,b, to meet the urgent need to treat patients, particularly young children, with severe diarrhoeal disease. The Dhaka Hospital has developed into a nationally important treatment centre and provides an infrastructure for an extensive programme of clinical research. Clinical services were also introduced at Matlab Hospital.

As many other factors affect the risk of diarrhoeal diseases or recovery from them – including nutritional status, income, education of mothers, access to clean water, sanitation habits and efficacy of vaccines – research at CRL expanded into new areas of public health. However, it retained its primary focus on evidence-based solutions able to deliver significant public health benefits at low cost to those living in poverty. 

From CRL to icddr,b

In 1978, the CRL received fresh impetus and a new name – the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. In recent years, we have been known simply as icddr,b.

Our research continued to expand, to address the major public health threats facing Bangladesh and other countries of the global South. Extensive research programmes were implemented in areas such as malnutrition, respiratory disease, vaccine testing, maternal, neonatal and child health, and health systems. We have maintained a strong and productive relationship with the Government of Bangladesh, and played an influential role in informing and evaluating national health policies and practice.

icddr,b is recognised as a national asset, and has contributed to the significant improvements in health achieved by Bangladesh in recent decades, despite the challenges posed by limited resources. In 2001, we received the first Gates Award for Global Health in recognition of our development of ORS. In 2005, we received the Independence Day Award, Bangladesh’s most prestigious national award.

We have also been committed to sharing our expertise, for example through an extensive training programme used by thousands of public health professionals, researchers and others from Bangladesh and other countries of the global South. 

In addition, our researchers and clinicians have played major roles in international responses to global humanitarian crises, particularly to prevent and control outbreaks of infectious disease. Over the past 30 years, our staff have supported multiple relief efforts across Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa.

Looking forward, our goal is to continue generating the evidence to underpin further improvements in public health in Bangladesh, while also ensuring that our research benefits those living in other countries of the global South.



icddr,b’s Strategic goals:

Goal One: Maintain a Focused Research Strategy
Goal Two: Develop and Promote Use of Innovations for Bangladesh and the global South
Goal Three: Clinical and Humanitarian Services and Response
Goal Four: Invest in our Research Platforms and Field Sites
Goal Five: Increase the Visibility and Impact of Our Research Evidence
Goal Six: Invest in Our People
Goal Seven: Improve Organisational Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness
Goal Eight: Ensure Financial Sustainability

icddr,b Governance structure

icddr,b is led by an experienced management team, and benefits from input from internationally recognised experts in global health and international health research.

The Board of Trustees is icddr,b’s governing body and provides strategic oversight. icddr,b’s Board of Trustees comprises 17 health professionals and researchers representing both developed and developing countries. The Board was created by an Ordinance of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Three members are nominated by the People’s Republic of the Government of Bangladesh, with the World Health Organization and UNICEF nominating one member each. icddr,b’s Executive Director serves as the Member-Secretary. The Board operates under the icddr,b Ordinance and follows the Rules of Procedure. The Board of Trustees’ roles and responsibilities include fund oversight; approving and monitoring the budget; setting broad institution-wide policies, as well as monitoring adherence to the Strategic Plan; employing, evaluating and supporting the Executive Director; maintaining the line between governance and management; and evaluating the Board’s own performance. 

The Senior Leadership Team (SLT), led by the Executive Director, is responsible for icddr,b’s day-to-day activities and implementing its institutional strategy. The SLT also includes the Deputy Executive Director, the Senior Directors of the Scientific Divisions, and Directors of Finance and Human Resources. In addition, it has specific departments like Regulatory and Legal Affairs, Supply Chain and Facilities Management, Communications, Information Technology, Research Administration and Technical Training Unit to  support research. The Research Administration Unit provides technical assistance for preparation and management of research proposals and monitors the human subjects review process through the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

The international Scientific Advisory Group provides scientific advice to icddr,b’s Executive Director. The purpose of the SAG is to: build capacity in the training and mentorship of young scientists on their career pathways; increase the involvement of international scientists on site at icddr,b; increase partnership opportunities with other world-class organisations; increase icddr,b’s ability to undertake research outside of Bangladesh, and align icddr,b’s research focus with our research priorities.

As a research institution, icddr,b has always been committed to strong monitoring and impact evaluation. Through ongoing use and development of the log frame used for reporting to our core donors, icddr,b systematically tracks how funds are administered and the impact of research through measurable results. Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of our currently expired Strategic Plan fell under the scope of one of its Goals and it resulted in (1) developing—and ensuring adherence to—a detailed, time-bound implementation plan, and (2) developing a revised set of indicators acceptable to our Core Donors and Board of Trustees to ensure that the plan delivered the anticipated results. icddr,b has a very strong Internal Oversight (IO) office in order to detect fraud and prevent its occurrence. Vigorous internal audit reviews deters financial impropriety and ensure value for money. The institution faces more than 30 project audits every year on top of its annual institutional audit.   taken. The Senior Leadership Team (SLT) of icddr,b provides oversight and is accountable to the Board of Trustees. Furthermore, an annual review commissioned by the Core Donor Group provides an independent assessment of our performance and complements our own monitoring and evaluation.

The Institutional Governance Framework (IGF) of icddr,b outlines the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct expected of staff members and the Code promote among others, human rights and culture of safety. Additionally, icddr,b has formulated a number of policies for Human resource, Supply Chain management, Finance, Scientific and research, gender equity, prevention of sexual harassment and child protection and Information Technology. 

icddr,b’s Institutional Capacity Statement:

icddr,b is an autonomous non-profit, international health research organization, located in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, dedicated to improving the lives of people living in poverty in its host country Bangladesh and globally. Through the generation of knowledge, and translation of research into treatment, training and policy advocacy, icddr,b addresses some of the most critical health concerns facing the world today. 

•	Research: 
Established in 1960, icddr,b has developed and delivered low-cost, scalable solutions to major public health problems— such as oral rehydration solution (ORS), zinc for diarrhoeal treatment, tetanus vaccines for new born and new born care, which saved and continue to save millions of lives globally. icddr,b developed an innovative method for managing severe acute malnutrition in children, which reduced death rates by nearly half. Results were published in the Lancet, and the standardised protocol is now endorsed by the WHO throughout the region. icddr,b has rigorously tested the efficacy of many new vaccines for diseases that affect the poor – including rotavirus vaccines, the Hib vaccine, a maternal pneumonia vaccine for protecting infants, and an affordable oral cholera vaccine. Results have helped to shape Bangladesh’s Extended Programme on Immunisation and provided evidence to support vaccine use in other resource-poor settings. The innovative use of female community health workers at Matlab in the 1970s greatly increased contraceptive use and reduced fertility. The work was highly influential nationally, leading to a national programme of family welfare assistants providing family planning support, and internationally. icddr,b has maintained a long-running programme of research on violence against women. Our research and advocacy activities have had major impact, raising awareness of domestic violence, leading to changes in Bangladesh law and introduction of interventions to reduce violence against women.

Few major practical innovations made by icddr,b’s researchers in recent times are ultra-low cost Bubble CPAP device to deliver oxygen to young children with severe pneumonia, the Urban Health Atlas (a GIS-based online tool), a range of affordable ready-to-use therapeutic and complementary food, based on locally available ingredients (such as rice, lentils and chickpeas), Q-MAT (a birthing mat), and a social enterprise model for detecting undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) in the community. 

A significant contribution has been made by our researchers in providing a clearer picture of the spread of antibiotic resistance in Bangladesh. In 2017, icddr,b has begun a five-year implementation research project to generate evidence and promote the use of evidence-based research and policy analysis for health planning and decision making. 

icddr,b has been conducting studies with marginalised and stigmatised populations at risk of HIV, translating evidence into policy, and developing interventions to generate impact at the population level. Integral to its research, icddr,b provides high-quality care, free of charge, to over 200,000 Bangladeshis annually.

•	icddr,b’s response to COVID-19 pandemic
icddr,b has been actively monitoring the development of novel coronavirus disease pandemic since December 2019, with particular focus on the health and well-being of the people of Bangladesh, as well as on the continuity of research, and hospital operations, which treats annually more than 200,000 diarrhoeal disease patients free-of-charge. icddr,b has been providing support to the Government of Bangladesh and its partners, responding to the urgent needs of the country. 

icddr,b has been working closely with the Government of Bangladesh in its COVID-19 response through various capacities from disease diagnosis to capacity building and research activities. In addition, numbers of research projects and trial are ongoing on COVID-19. icddr,b is currently working in collaboration with UNICEF to setup a 200 bed COVID-19 hospital for the vulnerable FDMN population at icddr,b’s Teknaf field site in Cox's Bazar. In an effort to support the livelihood of the transgender and sex worker and the local under privileged group affected due to OVID-19 humanitarian assistance has been provided. Capacity development assistance to local health service providers on critical case management of patients suffering from COVID-19 and providing COVID-19 care to all icddr,b staff, their dependents and family members living with them at this critical situation within its set up are phenomenal.

•	Collaboration: 
icddr,b has worked with over 100 organisations including Government of Bangladesh (GoB), other national governments, international institutions and national and international civil society partners and NGOs. icddr,b is supported by over 50 donor countries and organisations, including the host country government, UN agencies, USAID, DFID, foundations, universities, research institutes and private-sector organisations and companies. icddr,b has ample experience of successful collaboration with internal and external stakeholders including Government of Bangladesh and reputed research institutions/universities worldwide to carry forward our research agenda. Our work has had a major impact on the health of people in Bangladesh – and in other countries of the global South. We develop innovative products and generate rigorous evidence that has influenced health policy and practice in Bangladesh and globally. The institution, at any given time, has more than 100 research projects ongoing.

•	Institutional Review capacity: 
icddr,b attaches great importance to the development of high-standard research proposals (technically and scientifically sound and meeting international ethical standards) by its scientists and collaborating institutions. We have satisfactory processes in place to meet Research Integrity and Ethics. icddr,b’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) consists of four mandatory committees: Research Review Committee (RRC), Ethical Review Committee (ERC), Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (AEEC) and Programme Coordination Committee (PCC). Besides these mandatory committees, there are several subcommittees of the ERC: Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Audit/Monitoring Subcommittee. In any given year, icddr,b is subject to more than thirty project audits done by external independent auditors. Moreover, there is an institutional audit every year. In addition, internal functions are regularly audited by the Internal Oversight (IO) department of icddr,b. icddr,b’s Conflict of Interest Policy requires Board of Trustee Members, management and staff members to declare conflict of interest annually. icddr,b is committed to strict adherence and any violation of conflict of interest policy may constitute cause for disciplinary or other administrative action pursuant to Staff Regulations and Rules.

•	Research facilities and resources: 
icddr,b hosts some of the finest research laboratories and its clinical diagnostic laboratories serve as reference laboratories for clinical diagnostic analysis of human disease cohorts and control subjects. The diagnostic laboratories are the only accredited labs under ISO15189 (quality) and ISO15190 (safety) in Bangladesh for as many as 160 different tests and parameters. Approximately 1500 patients and individuals avail diagnostic services each day from the diagnostic OPD of the Centre, in addition to the in-patient cohorts and patients referred from icddr,b staff clinic. icddr,b also operates other research support facilities such as the Genomics Centre that provides exquisite services in the areas of genomics, metagenomics, exon sequencing and microRNA sequencing etc. A state of art animal house and a bacteriological media facility also cater to the requirements of the researchers from within icddr,b and outside collaborators. The bio-safety and bio-security as well as laboratory quality monitoring and quality assurance services are ensured. icddr,b also hosts an impressive and well maintained bio-repository which houses all archived biological materials in an ordered and classified manner. 

•	Training: 
icddr,b offers a huge range of technical training to increase expertise and capacity for public health and allied practitioners and researchers in Bangladesh and beyond. Our training unit works in collaboration with scientific divisions/units within icddr,b and institutions/universities/organizations globally to enhance visibility of icddr,b and  its sphere of influence in the policy, program and practice.

Fulfilling its commitment to share discoveries with the world, icddr,b has trained an incredible 50,000 health professionals from over 87 countries in public health education to improve health outcomes of disadvantaged populations, particularly poor women and children. This training has had extraordinary impact over the years building capacity of foreign and Bangladeshi students, while also deepening the knowledge base and skills of practicing professionals.

•	Award and achievement: 
One of icddr,b's greatest contributions lies in its diligent dissemination and scale-up of findings and discoveries through this large network. icddrb has shared its wealth of knowledge with the world by training more than 50,000 health professionals from over 87 countries. icddr,b's focus and contributions to the humanitarian work  has earned national and international recognition, including the UNICEF Maurice Pate award for service to children (1986), the Government of Bangladesh's highest honour, The Independence Day Award (2005), the first-ever Gates Award for Global Health (2001) and most recently, the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize (2017). Besides these, icddr,b also won USAID’s ‘Science and Technology for Development Award’ in 1987. In 2018, icddr,b researchers published more than 396 scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals. 

•	Financial capacity: 
The organization is financially stable having an annual budget of US$60 million per year on an average over the last 3 years. As an international health research institute, icddr,b is allowed by the local regulations to receive funds from foreign sponsors. Currently, the institute receives grants from donors like DFID, UKAid, Sida, the Gates Foundation, US Agencies, the Global Fund, EU, NIH etc. icddr,b has both local and foreign currency accounts and they can be reconciled. icddr,b has two budget procedures from preparation to execution. Project budgets are approved by Director Finance and Donors, whereas, the institutional budget is prepared annually and approved by Board of Trustees (BoT). The respective section head prepares the institutional budget; it is reviewed by Finance before submitting to the BoT for approval. The ERP system has strong budgetary control mechanisms which facilitates variance analysis reports on monthly, quarterly and annual basis.

“What the Arab world needs today is an educational revolution; we need a fundamental change that will fulfil every parent’s ambition to provide their child with a quality education.”

Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah, 2013

From its founding in 2013 by Her Majesty Queen Rania of Jordan, the Queen Rania Foundation (QRF) has aimed to be the premier resource on educational issues, in Jordan and around the Arab world, and to act as an incubator for new ideas and initiatives. In the firm belief that education is the foundation of economic, political and social development, QRF’s mandate has focused on identifying gaps and opportunities for developing new education programs, with the aim of influencing policy and creating educational change on the ground. QRF’s focus is perhaps best exemplified through the launch of Edraak.org an online education platform that localized open source technology developed by Harvard and MIT to reach over a million learners across the Arab world with free high quality educational material in less than 3 years.

The Middle East region is now the world’s largest producer and host of forced displacement. With the number of refugees and displaced people across the Middle East reaching almost 15 million, QRF believes it is imperative now more than ever to reinvent education from the ground up. Education must suit the needs of a shifting geopolitical landscape and a more mobile population – forced or otherwise.

Re-inventing School Education
Jordan and the Middle East region are at a critical point. Whereas others may choose to dwell on the challenges, Her Majesty has always maintained that “Pessimism doesn’t change the reality; it prolongs the status quo… Optimism and faith coupled with pragmatism change the reality”. It is imperative upon the people of Jordan and the region to embrace the current status quo as an opportunity to disrupt existing legacy systems of education, healthcare, and infrastructure. In that light, and in response to the incoming waves of refugee children in Jordan, QRF aims to position Jordan as the ideal setting to reinvent school education through an impact focused approach to learning.

Over the next 5 years, QRF will focus on a subset of public schools that are hosting both Jordanian and Syrian refugee students, combined with learners that are out of school for a number of factors. The Foundation will aim to reach 150,000 school-age students between 3 and 15 years of age with teacher-targeted localized innovative solutions that improve learner’s socio-emotional skills, numeracy, and literacy.

To successfully disrupt the education sector, it will be critical to start at the bottom of the pyramid where resources are constrained and there is an imperative to do more with less. QRF will identify and channel funding to the most suitable innovations (technological or otherwise), localize them when necessary, and run rigorous assessments for impact. The defining aspects of QRF’s approach are the focus on rigorous evaluation methods to “solve for impact” and the mixed funding approach to ensure that both public and private sector thinking can be combined to solve these critical challenges. Successful deployments will then be scaled via public-private partnerships across the Jordanian public school system. QRF will widely share the results of all of its interventions to ensure that any lessons learned are accessible to educators and learners across the globe –especially those working within developing settings and forced migration challenges.

Within its target schools, QRF will center on 5 areas for its interventions. The focus areas have been identified through a rigorous research process using internal and external experts to ensure limited resources are directed to the issues with the highest potential for impact on learning and society. The five focus areas are: improving learning outcomes for boys, creating more structured classroom pedagogy, introducing regular formative assessment, creating strong school leadership and positive culture, and raising parental awareness and engagement in the early years of a child’s life.  These focus areas will be buttressed by three crosscutting themes that have always been central to QRF’s operations and interventions: a clear understanding of the transformative power of technology (and its limitations), provision of a healthy socioemotional school climate, and finally ensuring selected interventions are readily scalable on national levels.

As a small country, with very little resources, and in a turbulent region, Jordan has always relied on the support of visionary friends and partners to help it develop into a model of stability and moderation across the region. In the same vein, QRF seeks the support of the international community and leaders in the public and private sector to help it transform Jordan into the ideal setting to catalyze education for the developing world and especially the Middle East region. As stability returns to war torn countries such as Yemen, Libya and Syria there will need to be clear models of education that can help them make up for lost time.",0,0,0,22,0,cc-by,active,0

The FMS is the only women’s fund of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay that led women’s groups and movements working to achieve long– term social change. The FMS´s missionis to mobilize financial and technical resources and strengthen organisational capacities of women's organisations in situation of most socio-economic, cultural and environmental disadvantages in Latin America and the Southern Cone, which aim to advance gender equality as the path for a just and equitable social change.

The FMS supports women’s groups and organisations and women right’s defenders to advance women’s rights and gender equality in Latin America, with focus on the southern cone sub region. It has two key mandates (i) mobilizing international and local resources and grantmaking towards women’s rights work; (ii) building social movement with capacity development towards social change. 

The FMS mobilizes resources to support women’s rights groups and organisations through direct and flexible grants from an equal and transparent partnership, based on the conviction that women have enormous potential to be agents of social change. We believe that if women and their organisations are empowered to defend their rights and access to equal opportunities to fulfill their potential, we will contribute with inclusive, participative and sustainable models of development and wellbeing at the community level. 

To ensure the realization of its mission, the FMS focuses on:  

-Empowering women’s of most disadvantaged groups decision making and political agency by both strengthening their organizing and advocacy skills and supporting the development of inclusive and democratic leaderships, respectful of diversity and multiculturality and with regional and subregional-wide visions.

- Supporting exclusively groups and organisations led and composed by women of the most disadvantaged groups in societies and fund controversial and traditionally marginalized and invisibilized issues at the community level; such as labour rights of women workers from precarious sectors like domestic and sewing workers; environmental rights of indigenous women’s rights defenders; criminalization of women’s human rights defenders and activists; LGTTTBI, among others.

-Influencing community philanthropy and development aid sectors to increase the resources available for women’s human rights initiatives. The ultimate goal is to impact the culture of philanthropy in Latin America from a sustainable, participatory and inclusive development approach with focus on raising awareness about women’s human rights; thus changing the social landscape.

This means we work in some of the most complex, insecure, and fast-changing environments in the world, and as such the safety and security of our people and partners is paramount. Any information that compromises this – and merely confirming our presence in certain locations may be enough to do this – is excluded from our IATI publications. This means that some fields may be excluded on some activities. 

As a rights-based organisation we have a commitment to safeguard children, especially those with whom we are in contact.  Therefore we will not publish any information that could identify an individual child.  More information can be found in our Child Safeguarding Policy.  

We may also exclude any politically or culturally sensitive information that may hinder our ability to operate in certain locations, including information that could put at risk the safety and security of beneficiaries, staff and partners. We may also exclude data that we cannot share for privacy, confidentiality, or wider regulatory or statutory reasons.

The number of activities excluded in their entirety is negligible.  ,"Our data is extracted from our award/finance management systems each quarter.  As it is taken directly and unaudited, it offers the highest possible level of transparency on our activities.

It is important to publish timely data reflective of the fast-changing nature of Save the Children’s programmes.  This does, however, mean it may differ from the high-quality, audited information that we share through our Annual Report.  For example, our exclusions policy means that the financial information found in our IATI data and Annual Report will not correspond, and for a comprehensive overview the latter document remains the most appropriate source – it is available at: www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us
",GB,"Save the Children works in more than 120 countries. We give millions of children life-saving healthcare, nutritious food, protection from abuse, and the chance to go to school. When disaster strikes we do whatever it takes to save children’s lives. We work hard to give the poorest children in the UK a better start in life too – both at home and at school. And we challenge global leaders to keep the promises they’ve made to transform the world for children. Save the Children UK is a member of the global Save the Children movement, which is made up of 29 separate national entities. Our international programmes are designed in conjunction with national donors and implemented by Save the Children International.",We currently publish sector information using our own vocabulary,0,"We have provided all information that our systems currently permit as well as other data that we have been able to add within reasonable cost. Publication on certain activities may be pending, subject to official notification of donor permission. 

As above, in our IATI publications an activity is an individual grant or contract, broken down by country or region of implementation. In our internal systems, multi-country grants and contracts are set up as internal ‘funding streams’ with ‘child’ awards for each country. We do this in order to facilitate financial reconciliations between country offices. Due to the way information is held within our systems, ‘parent’ funding streams and their child awards are all published as separate IATI activities, with their relationship indicated using IATI’s ‘related activity’ elements. The parent funding stream IATI activity will not have certain fields/elements (description, sector, recipient-country/region, document-link and records of expenditure). These are published on the child award’s IATI activity file only. In addition, incoming funds may only be recorded against the parent activity (the initial way our systems were set up). In late 2016 we introduced recording of income against the child activity as well (to be phased in across live and new awards). 

Our systems do not easily map against the IATI categories for completion / post-completion, therefore we have adopted ‘implementation’ to cover all award activity (e.g. programme activity may have ended but financial reconciliation, etc. is still ongoing). Therefore in some instances an award status may display as ‘implementation’ even after its planned end date. In December 2017 we published our first set of result for some of our DFID-funded work and will continue to increase the range of activities for which we publish results.",21,"The majority of data is published as a single activities file, not segmented by country or region.

This aspiration is realised through a range of initiatives designed to tackle development challenges in some of the poorest countries in the world.  Through a range of approaches, Stars aims to support local actors to address problems they identify by providing access to funding and non-financial support. 
Stars believes that well-run local organisations are best placed to respond to the needs of their communities and the young people in their care. All too often however, they are constrained by a rigid approach to partnerships and funding which can limit their effectiveness. 
Stars’ flagship activity is the annual ‘Impact Awards’ which recognise and reward effective and well-managed local organisations working in the fields of child health, education, protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). Stars aims to select a winner and runner-up in each field across three regions: Africa-Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America-the Caribbean. The Awards are open to applications from the 100 countries with the highest rates of under-five mortality (http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/apply/eligibility-2/).

1.	Developing frameworks for sovereign debt instruments linked to nature performance, which have been piloted in several countries.
2.	Advising governments and financial institutions on strategies to align economic policies with biodiversity conservation goals.

We also capture the perspective of field staff and local partner organisations as a counterpoint to the views of those caught up in humanitarian crises.
We believe that the intended beneficiaries of humanitarian aid should have more of a say in how aid is provided. Through our work, we help them communicate their feedback to policymakers and aid providers in the most effective way possible. We regularly engage with people affected by crisis to discover whether they find humanitarian services relevant and fair, if they trust aid agencies, and whether they feel empowered. Our goal is to make their perceptions the touchstone and driver of humanitarian effectiveness. To achieve this, we champion the views of people affected by crisis at the global level and wherever decisions about aid are made.",0,0,0,21,0,odc-by,active,0

The Hague Academy for Local Governance specialises in practice-oriented training courses and study visits for civil servants, local practitioners, and professionals at donor and development organisations.

Leaders at the local level must demonstrate responsibility, responsiveness and a clear vision for the future of their communities. Moreover, they need skilled people to manage and deliver services in a transparent and effective way. To achieve this, citizens should have the capacity to put forward their needs and ideas to improve their community and hold their governments accountable.

Through training and education programmes, we seek to develop knowledge and skills required to improve local governance and decentralisation in developing and post-conflict societies.

The Hague Academy is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation established by VNG International in 2006, and with the support from the municipality of The Hague.

In 2008, The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs recognized the Academy as a leading institution on local governance innovation.",0,0,0,80,0,cc-by,active,0

IPCG conducted more than 100 dialogue sessions on divisive issues such as the renaming of streets, dismantling of the Soviet monuments, European integration, reintegration of displaced persons, decentralization and local mechanisms of decision-making.

2. Restorative Practices in Schools. 
IPCG looks to introduce into schools a holistic and comprehensive approach that combines the efforts of school administration, staff, parents and pupils for building an atmosphere of respect, concern and responsibility, through the formation of school centers, where prepared pupils-mediators help their peers resolve conflicts through co-operation.
 
3. Restorative Justice. IPCG is an active promoter in Ukraine of restorative justice – a process, managed by a mediator, whereby a delinquent and a victim discuss the situation that has occurred together and decide about further resolution of a conflict and questions of restitution, thereby empowering participants in the process of conflict resolution and allowing them to take responsibility for consequences of this situation. A court usually takes this decision into account during sentencing.

“Chance for Childhood will not make information public that would:
•	Compromise the safety and security of Chance for Childhood staff, partners or communities they serve;
•	Result in Chance for Childhood or our partners’ operations being banned, restricted or suspended;
•	Cause a negative impact on the communities we serve;
•	Break legal, copyright, child protection, data protection, partner confidentiality, commercial or contractual obligations;
•	Be considered to be of no/little public interest or if the request is made in an unreasonable manner.
•	Have financial or time implications disproportionate to the request.”
","As outlined in our monitoring and evaluation strategy CfC is committed to ensure quality data is rigorously collected and analysed across all of our programmes so as to ensure evidence is generated and used to inform future programming.  Within CfC data is collected and used to estimate the demand and appropriateness of our services, understand key characteristics of the people we work with, find out which services are working for which people, establish whether an impact has been generated and how long the impact is likely to last.

CfC’s approach to data and evidence is guided by the following principles:

•	Transparency – data and evidence are to contribute to CfC’s external and internal accountability, by generating solid and accessible evidence that clearly explains CfC’s scope and reach (what we do, where we work and the people we reach) and tells CfC’s impact story (our contribution to impact and outcomes) highlighting different perspectives of children and key stakeholders in decisions and actions throughout the life cycle of a project or initiative. This includes accountability to participants, donors and other stakeholders.
•	Learning – data and evidence is conducive to learning and potentially to multiplying impact, by generating and documenting evidence that strengthens the organisational memory and expertise, plus energises learning dialogues and the identification of successful models and/or opportunities for scale-up.
•	Inclusion – data collection and its analysis also needs to respect the safety and dignity of stakeholders with whom CfC works by using ethical methods and incorporating perspectives of all target groups including children affected by disabilities. 
•	Gender responsive – data and evidence systems and practices should promote gender equality, by ensuring ethical data collection methods and evidence are selected and different perspectives for boys and girls/ men and women are taken into account and respond to any gender specific recommendation or request.
•	Child participation – children and young people need to be consistently involved in the data collection processes as they are the primary beneficiaries and agents of CfC’s work.
Recognising that it is only though effective data analysis that we can keep track of our performance and impact, data itself plays a pivotal role in strengthening effectiveness of CfC interventions. Data analysis will only provide a realistic insight and will suggest real-time and practical measures if the data is genuine and free from any errors, discrepancies or interpretations. Therefore, it is essential to maintain the neutrality, credibility, quality and accuracy of the collected data.

The efficacy and accuracy of the data collection process at CfC is guaranteed by the following measures in the data collection techniques. 

1.	Use of reliable data resources. Data resources play the most crucial role in effective data collection and further analysis. When collecting data, we seek to ensure the reliability and credibility of data collectors and systems responsible for data and information generation. We do this by delivering specific training in data collection methods and continuously supporting partners to gather and analyse data.

2.	Set data quality goals: we set realistic goals and quality thresholds against which we assess and improve overall data quality. 

3.	Review the Data: Reviewing is an efficient way to check quality and appropriateness of the data. We therefore have in place ways to review and double check the data entered, for instance through spot checks carried out by senior managers or, in the case of external evaluations, through a quality assurance professional who reviews the data and assists in reducing the data errors.

4.	Triangulation: in every internal or external evaluation we systematically use different data sources to triangulate and validate data through cross verification. This allows us to test the consistency of findings obtained through various instruments and assess some of the threats or multiple causes influencing our results.

5.	Confidentiality: linking to our data protection policy we ensure that data collected, particularly sensitive data, does not harm the identity and privacy of our stakeholders. We therefore ensure anonymity of participants, confidentiality of results and always seek consent forms.

IhsanRD main activities are included in the five humanitarian programs:
* Food Security and Livelihood:
This program focuses on two main types of support: Emergency Aid and Sustainable Support.
Emergency Aid: Syrian communities have suffered a significant increase in violence due to the ongoing conflict, forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. Our staff members in the field quickly identify community needs and respond promptly by distributing ready-to-eat rations and food baskets, as well as by supporting local bakeries.
Sustainable Support: IhsanRD supports and sustains local agriculture by providing key resources, such as seeds, fertilizer, fuel, and additional raw materials necessary for successful farming. We conduct training on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) to educate farmers and increase our impact. This training introduces new agricultural technologies, such as “inter-cropping,” which unused land between olive groves optimizing production. 
 We also conduct programs that provide the most vulnerable households with opportunities to earn income. Through this program, households conduct rehabilitation of community assets in exchange for cash given to vulnerable families.

* Protection:
This program focuses on supporting children and victims of gender-based violence.
Child Protection: IhsanRD established several new centers in  Syrian governorates to provide children in need with improved access to quality protection resources. These centers provide structured recreational and psycho-social support, as well as case management services, to affected boys and girls. Our team also manages mobile units to provide recreational psychosocial support to children who cannot access our centers. These units generally administer services in local schools, mosques, community centers, and camps.
Gender-Based Violence: IhsanRD delivers services to victims of gender-based violence through safe spaces, which provide women and girls with a safe support network, as well as psycho-social services and vocational training. These programs enable women to find jobs in clinics, hospitals, and local organizations.

* WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE (WASH)
IhsanRD has significantly increased WASH programs in select areas in Syria to rehabilitate critical water networks and sewage systems. As part of the rehabilitation process, we perform the following activities: • Installing critical hardware, such as generators and pumps • Rehabilitating water storage units • Rehabilitating piping networks destroyed during the conflict  • Supporting operations and maintenance of WASH units in cooperation with Local Councils by providing incentives, toolkits, fuel, and chlorine • Administering technical training • We also train community members to establish cost-recovery systems, and how to collect fees from local households to ensure that communities can continue operating their water systems after IhsanRD withdraws.

* Education:
This program focuses on expanding our education efforts in order to reach more children and provide better services. Our projects include: • Rehabilitating and renovating schools • Providing material resources and guides; including Education in Emergencies and Child Safe-Guarding guides for educators • Offering technical support and incentives for teachers and administrators • Delivering kits to teachers and students • Providing heaters and fuel for schools during winter • Conducting training programs on Education in Emergencies, Teachers in Crisis Contexts, Psychosocial Support, Child Safe-Guarding, and other important topics • Organizing awareness sessions for children, based on international standards, that cover various topics, such as avoiding remnants of war, maintaining personal hygiene, and returning to the education system • Managing vocational training centers in traditional school spaces to provide youth with professional skills and to enable them to transition into the job market • Building referral mechanisms within schools to provide vulnerable children with psychological services in cooperation with Ihsan’s Protection team • Establishing safety and security plans and providing schools with safety equipment, such as fire extinguishers and first aid kits.

* NON-FOOD ITEMS & SHELTER :
This program focuses on providing life-saving assistance to families fleeing violence or facing harsh weather conditions. Displaced families lack access to basic non-food items. IhsanRD provides essential materials, such as blankets, solar lamps, and mattresses, to the most vulnerable families living in dire conditions. 
We also provide families with tents and manage local centers to support individuals with nowhere to go.
In addition, we distribute winter kits and clothing through in-kind donations and voucher programs.",n/a,All project data will be quality checked at the time of upload which is then completed by the Management & Financial Support Officer.

1. Introduction
Amnesty International - The Netherlands values transparency and accountability. Therefore Amnesty International - The Netherlands decided to publish its project data. Amnesty International - The Netherlands commits itself to publish its project data set compliant to the IATI standard. The first IATI compliant project data set will be published at no later than 30-04-2016. The projects that ran in the period 01-01-2016 and 30-03-2016 will be included in the data set. Amnesty International - The Netherlands embraces the principle “Open, unless…”. This means that Amnesty International - The Netherlands remains to have the right to exclude project information from publication to IATI if it falls in one of the following categories:
•	Information disclosure affecting relations between partner organization and government/other NGOs (human rights work or work in some conflict affected states);
•	Detailed specific information affecting and jeopardizing the safety and security of NGO staff, partner staff or beneficiaries;
•	Personal information of individual staff and/or partners (e.g. addresses and telephone numbers);
•	Commercially sensitive information (salaries, consultant fees);
•	Information that is exempt under data protection laws or by pre-existing organizational policies.
2. Articles
2.1 General principles for exclusion
External relations
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, authorities  or institutions of Amnesty International - The Netherlands, its partners or other donors. All partner organizations and donors
are informed on forehand about Amnesty International - The Netherlands’s policies concerning publishing project data . All the parties have the possibility to request exclusion on forehand, based on the principles in this exclusion policy. Amnesty International - The Netherlands is, at all times, the final decision-maker for the exclusion of data.
Security
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data of which it can be expected that it might pose a risk to
the safety and/or security of any individuals, local Amnesty International - The Netherlands offices, groups of beneficiaries, partner
organizations, donors or suppliers. From a security point of view it was decided to
publish transaction on a cumulative basis per quarter per activity.
Privacy
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish any information which is traceable to an individual person and that violates that person’s privacy without obtaining prior consent of that specific person involved.
Commercial/Strategic
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that might harm the commercial or strategic interests of Amnesty International - The Netherlands,
its partners, donors or suppliers. Information about the conditions and repayments of loans, investments and guarantees is part of this exclusion and will therefore not be published by Amnesty International - The Netherlands.
Legal/Contractual
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data if we do not have the right to publish the data. Amnesty International - The Netherlands will not publish the data if Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not hold the copyright on particular information or if contractual agreements with back donors or partner organizations impede Amnesty International - The Netherlands’s right to publish the data.

History
Amnesty International - The Netherlands publishes all project data of projects started after 01-01-2016  or ongoing projects
with new commitments of more than EUR 25,000 in 2016. 
Social impact
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that possibly harms the social impact of Amnesty International - The Netherlands in general or the related project in particular.
Openness and transparency about the exclusion policy
Amnesty International - The Netherlands is transparent about the exclusion policy that Amnesty International - The Netherlands applies to its published IATI compliant data set. This policy is therefore published on the publicly accessible website of Amnesty International - The Netherlands: www.paxvoorvrede.nl.
Published activities 
Amnesty International - The Netherlands will report all its projects as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier. However, other information might not be included if one or more categories that are mentioned in this exclusion policy apply. 
Data Quality
Amnesty International - The Netherlands values the quality and consistency of its open data. Therefore Amnesty International - The Netherlands publishes only
project data that meet the minimum requirements. The data quality concerning e.g. reliability will be assessed by program officers. Data that does not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.
3. Decision-making on excluding data
Amnesty International - The Netherlands has the right to exclude data. Information will be disclosed unless a project officer decides otherwise. The responsibility for excluding information is at the level where the information can be assessed in detail. It is possible to exclude a particular project, specific information fields of the IATI standard and/or specific documents from disclosure in the project administration. 
4. Review of exclusion policy and quality of data
On a quarterly basis the planning, monitoring and evaluation department of Amnesty International - The Netherlands will review all data excluded from disclosure. It will be reviewed whether data are rightly excluded and if the exclusion policy is still valid. The exclusion policy will be reviewed and if necessary adjusted on an annual basis.",0,NL,0,0,0,0,21,0,cc-by,active,0

It is a non-for-profit Jordanian institution that aims at improving the teaching of media and journalism in Jordan and the Arab world and developing the capacities of journalists, press, and media. It also aims at developing the communication capacities of public establishments and conducting media and communication research. 
(JMI)’s goal is to become a Center of Excellence in journalism education in Jordan and the region. JMI provides two pillars of services – a one year practical MA in Journalism and journalism training programes, in Arabic.
 
JMI offers the Master’s Program in cooperation with University of Jordan in accordance with the academic agreement between the two institutions.
 
JMI’s goal is to offer the best standards of journalistic practice with an emphasis on the traditional aspects of journalism such as writing and reporting, ethics and community issues. This, combined with new media courses, will enable JMI’s graduates to compete regionally and internationally.
 
Journalism academic experts from Jordan, the region and around the world have developed a unique practical curriculum and courses that are bench marked on international best practices while considering the uniqueness of the Arab region. World-class facilities, including newsrooms and studios, enable our students to learn production techniques on the very equipment they will later use as professionals.
“JMI’s goal is to offer a new level of journalism education in Jordan and the region, to help improve the public trust in journalism and empower a new generation of writers and thinkers capable of setting the standard for professional journalism in the Kingdom as well as the region and pushing Arab journalists to the forefront of international media activity”.

The Council’s mandate is to: inform the effective formulation and monitoring of government policy; evaluate policy implementation; stimulate public debate through the effective dissemination of research-based data and fact-based research results; foster research collaboration; and help build research capacity and infrastructure for the human sciences.
The Council conducts large-scale, policy-relevant, social-scientific research for public sector users, non-governmental organisations and international development agencies. Research activities and structures are closely aligned with South Africa’s national development priorities. The HSRC’s integrated research divisions provide single points of entry – complete with a critical mass of researchers – for interdisciplinary and problem-orientated research.

The organisation is home to about 500 staff members, all dedicated to support the conducting of 150-200 research projects per year on social science and humanities research. Its dedicated professional researchers, located in four provinces, are supported by a strong physical and institutional infrastructure, including technical and support positions, deployed countrywide to enable the organisation to respond efficiently and comprehensively to research needs.

On another level, the HSRC seeks to serve as a knowledge hub to bridge the gap between research, policy and action, thereby increasing the impact of research. This role is implemented through collaboration with key constituencies, including government and other research organisations, multilateral agencies, universities, and non-governmental, donor and development organisations. These relationships are being strengthened by the fact that many of our leading researchers serve on international scientific bodies.

The Council also monitors and evaluates policies and programmes providing objective information to assess the country’s progress in achieving its goals. Three examples of these are its contributions to monitor South Africa’s performance in implementing the country’s national HIV and AIDS strategic plans and policies; assessments of numeracy and literacy in education; and conducting an annual research and development (R&D) survey that informs the national R&D strategy. The HSRC has a strong footprint in other African countries through its affiliation with CODESRIA, participation in SADC and NEPAD, as well as hosting African Research Fellows in the organisation.

The Council’s research outputs include reports for users, occasional papers and scholarly articles in peer-reviewed journals, books and a news magazine that allows the organisation to improve the public understanding of science. These are disseminated in print through the HSRC Press, through policy briefs aimed at government and policymakers, and through the media, including social media platforms, the HSRC website, conferences and extensive research networks.

The Council has several world-class operational support programmes. Its finance, human resource management, enterprise and risk management, governance, legal and facilities units are well set up to provide good quality support to all research programmes and potential funders of the HSRC.",0,0,0,80,0,odc-by,active,0

BNPS has been working for policy reforms at the national level and organizing and mobilizing grassroots people at the community level through a variety of programs.

BNPS follows a bottom-up right-based approach linking community level organized efforts with national level to bring reforms. In this linking process its role is one of the catalysts and facilitators. BNPS has been trying to create a supportive environment for the women, minority and other marginalized groups raising their voice and claiming their entitlements through a list of activities, like critical understanding through development education, institution building, livelihood activities and reforms of different policies, system, institution and mindset. The congenial working environment, culture of co-operation and team work, non-hierarchical management with activist orientation has been recognized by all as an asset of BNPS.

So far BNPS has directly worked with around 200,000 women and for three decades more than 1,000,000 people from different background involved with the initiatives undertaken by BNPS, and it has been recognized as one of the most dynamic women’s organization in Bangladesh. It focuses on social, economical and political empowerment of women, gender equality, strengthening of local government, electoral reform, education reform and gender budget analysis. In addition, BNPS has been taking up many firm steps on many challenging issues like inheritance laws, women representation in power structure i.e. parliament and local government, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), Prevention of Violent Extremism (PVE), issues of women workers and Violence Against Women and Girls (VAW/G).

BNPS not only have the expertise and wisdom of working with women towards social, economical and political empowerment but also have the activist tenacity to take a political stand in the face of conservative lobbies for the cause of women and human rights. BNPS has been the pioneer in taking up challenging issues against conservative mindsets, which quiver the root of the extremist fundamentalists and their exploitative network.

Vision: A society free from all sorts of discrimination.   

Mission: Equality through empowerment and social transformation.

Objective: To carry out its mission, BNPS is striving to eliminate all sort of discrimination against disadvantaged people particularly women from family to society and state consistent with the principles of the constitution of Bangladesh and all human rights instruments of the United Nations.

Core Values: BNPS has an ideological base with some core values. These are considered as guiding factors that contribute as essential elements in developing all the programs implemented by the organization. The core values of the organization exclusively defined are: • Gender Sensitivity • Secularism • Inclusiveness and • Sustainability with special emphasis on environment",0,0,0,22,0,odc-by,active,0

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together.

Created in 1948, IUCN has evolved into the world’s largest and most diverse environmental network. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its 1,300 Member organisations and the input of some 16,000 experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. Our experts are organised into six commissions dedicated to species survival, environmental law, protected areas, social and economic policy, ecosystem management, and education and communication.

The ability to convene diverse stakeholders and provide the latest science, objective recommendations and on-the-ground expertise drives IUCN’s mission of informing and empowering conservation efforts worldwide. We provide a neutral forum in which governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples groups, faith-based organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges.

By facilitating these solutions, IUCN provides governments and institutions at all levels with the impetus to achieve universal goals, including on biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development, which IUCN was instrumental in defining.

Combined, our knowledge base and diverse membership make IUCN an incubator and trusted repository of best practices, conservation tools, and international guidelines and standards. As the only environmental organisation with official United Nations Observer Status, IUCN ensures that nature conservation has a voice at the highest level of international governance.

IUCN’s expertise and extensive network provide a solid foundation for a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects around the world. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people’s well-being. They also produce a wealth of data and information which feeds into IUCN’s analytical capacity.

Through their affiliation with IUCN, Member organisations are part of a democratic process, voting Resolutions which drive the global conservation agenda. They meet every four years at the IUCN World Conservation Congress to set priorities and agree on the Union’s work programme. IUCN congresses have produced several key international environmental agreements including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the World Heritage Convention, and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. We continue to help these conventions strengthen and evolve so that they can respond to emerging challenges.

Our Member organisations are represented by the IUCN Council – the governing body. Headquartered in Switzerland, IUCN Secretariat comprises around 900 staff in more than 50 countries. ",0,0,0,15,0,notspecified,active,0
